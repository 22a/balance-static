Hi! Emiin Vanih [Lamia] here. Myself and my companions have developed a compendium of information that will hopefully help you take your Dark Knight playstyle to a new level. While tanking is easy to learn, with the right know-how, you can excel at the role, and lead your group to victory.</description></item><item><title>An In-Depth Guide To Guns and Robots v5.5</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/basic-mch-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/basic-mch-stuff/</guid><description>Job Overview Machinist is a fast-paced physical ranged job that excels at quick burst damage and has the added benefit of free movement. While the base rotation for this job is somewhat strict, Machinist excels in dumping burst into raid buffs with flexible use of its gauge system. This guide’s aim is to break down the job’s rotation into something easy to digest whilst providing good practices to follow for overall gameplay.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/astrologian-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/astrologian-guide/</guid><description>Intro to Astrologian Who Needs MP When You’re This Pretty?

The Scope of this Guide As the title implies, this guide is intended to function as an introduction to Astrologian. This guide is concerned with Astrologian only. It will not address the general principles of healing as they apply to all healers. Those things are discussed in Zyrk’s Bullshit Guide to the Principles of Healing.</description></item><item><title>Becoming A Better Tank</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/guide/becoming-a-better-tank/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/guide/becoming-a-better-tank/</guid><description>Becoming A Better Tank Version 1.0 Torael Valdis | Jenova (NA) | Torael_Valdis#8120

You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. Shadowbringers brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.</description></item><item><title>Expert: The Shadowbringers Samurai Compendium</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/expert-the-shadowbringers-samurai-compendium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/expert-the-shadowbringers-samurai-compendium/</guid><description>The Shadowbringers Samurai Compendium An Exploration of 5.0 Samurai Mechanics By Jahaudant @ The Balance &amp;amp; DPS Tools Discords Last Updated 17th April 2020

For Shadowbringers the media tour was a pretty huge success, not only for media content creators but also for guide writers and theorycrafters.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/scholar-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/scholar-guide/</guid><description>Indomitable, A Thorough Guide to Scholar

You may also know me as “what?” and “literally who.” I’m here to talk about healing and stuff, because I guess I like it or something, mostly because I don’t respect myself.</description></item></channel></rss>

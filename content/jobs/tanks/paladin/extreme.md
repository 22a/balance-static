This encounter is particularly killtime-dependent to set up an optimal final phase re-opener during the last few miniphases. Shown here is the fastest practical re-opener, for a kill around x:50-x:00. For later kills on the minute (9:00, 10:00, etc), simply use a standard rotation after 415 seconds.


For kills at different spots in the minute (8:30, 9:30, etc), adjustments can be made after four minutes to delay Fight or Flight and Requiescat for a different re-opener without losing a usage. The final phase should ideally lead into a standard rotation with a natural kill at the end of Requiescat, although this won't always be possible.

# The Epic of Alexander (TEA)

## Phase optimization

### Phase 1 - Living Liquid & Liquid Hand

[Phase GCD spreadsheet](https://xiv.sleepyshiba.com/pld/sheets/tea1.png)

Delayed opener is optimal for this phase, but fast pushes may require a standard opener to ensure buffs and MP are available for Phase 2. Paladin should pull Liquid Hand, but does not necessarily need to hold the Hand all phase.

### Phase 2 - Brute Justice & Cruise Chaser

Party-specific. Pre-pull FoF (6th Hawk Blaster) is optimal for this phase. Try to maximize AoE with Requiescat, and only use Goring Blade on both targets if it will not waste Atonements.

Paladin should tank Brute Justice (if split) due to having fewer personal cooldowns for Mines, and typically needing to apply Goring Blade during Plasma Shield.

### Phase 3 - Alexander Prime

Try to maximize AoE with Requiescat on adds, unless delaying it will cost a usage before the end of the phase.

### Phase 4 - Perfect Alexander

Requiescat opener has a minor potency advantage over the entire phase if executed properly (unless skipping 3rd Temporal Prison). Pay special attention to immediately before and after FCÎ².

## Best-in-slot / BiS Gearsets

Augmented Law's Order weapons (515) or Blade's weapons (535) are optimal for synced content. Both have similar tiering in this content, so fully-upgrading the weapon is not essential, but Blade's weapon may reduce the dungeon grind if available:

### 2.40 - Patch 5.45+

Use Edengrace Bastard Sword (475) with one less direct hit meld and Edenmorn Scutum (535) before obtaining ultimate weapon or Augmented Law's Order weapon (515).

# The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)

For level 70 Ultimates, simply sync any level 80 gear with critical hit + determination and enough skill speed for personal preference at or above ilvl 418 (UCoB) or ilvl 470 (Ultima). Melds on synced gear are ignored, but built-in stats will be capped if the gear's original item level is high enough.

Certain non-synced gear pieces and Augmented Law's Order weapons (515) or Blade's weapons (535) are optimal for 4.X content. Use the level 70 sync module in the Tank Gear Manager to compare gear options precisely.

## Phase Optimization

UWU for Paladin is really killtime dependent but generally:

### Garuda

Start with Req opener and then delay second FoF in Garuda for Plumes. If you're not padding, you can choose whether or not to delay the second FoF, but usages are the same overall.

### Ifrit

Start with Req opener. Use FoF and hold Ifrit during nails. Use last Req at the end of the phase.

### Titan

This opener is dependent on whether you skip Ifrit dashes or not. Usually I just do a -3s prepull FoF.

### Ultima

* Pop FoF when he grows wings after eating Garuda and your opener is Goring > RA > Req.
* Delay the opening SW until after your first HS (MP issues later if you don't).
* FoF after Predation, then just do standard rotation.  
* Req reopener after Suppression.

# The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)

For level 70 Ultimates, simply sync any level 80 gear with critical hit + determination and enough skill speed for personal preference at or above ilvl 418 (UCoB) or ilvl 470 (Ultima). Melds on synced gear are ignored, but built-in stats will be capped if the gear's original item level is high enough.

Certain non-synced gear pieces and Augmented Law's Order weapons (515) or Blade's weapons (535) are optimal for 4.X content. Use the level 70 sync module in the Tank Gear Manager to compare gear options precisely.

## Phase Optimization

### Phase 1 & Phase 2 - Twin & Nael

FoF opener on Twin, use the last FoF immediately on cooldown to get a few more buffed GCDs.

It is definitely phase dependent but majority of groups I've done in ShB have always pushed at the same spot. If you see the last Hatch cast she will lock into it.

Req opener on Nael into 10 GCD FoF is what typically happens if you kill Twin at the aforementioned time, but it's also typically a forced 10 GCD FoF due to Chariot first anyway. First GCD CoS and use on cooldown.

If you do not skip divebombs (squad is not a bunch of gamers), then use the Req immediately after she gets back and just HS (check to see if you can refresh Goring based on killtime. On farm you probably won't if you clean up Nael more).

### P3 - Bahamut

Bahamut opener is a -3s FoF opener and end the first opening phase on Fast. Riot Blade combo carries over to when the boss is targetable again.

After Quickmarch, do Riot > Req > Goring into four HS Req. You'll get an extra RA off which is a 25p gain and the Req 1 GCD earlier helps align it better after Blackfire.

Check MP before uptime on this next one.

During Blackfire trio, pop FoF when Bahamut dives before Megaflares go out and do first GCD HS (unbuffed) into Goring > Goring > Req 5 HS > RA.

After Fellruin Trio, press FoF immediately on cooldown and do Goring > Goring > RA > (Req will come up sometime here - and press it immediately on cooldown) and finish your RA combo. Due to weird phase timing you may not get a 3rd HS off. If that's the case, do two HS into Fast blade. Ideally you get three HS off but it's better to do a Fast Blade than ghost a HS.

After Heavensfall towers, your FoF will come back up slightly before the boss is targetable. Use it on cooldown. Goring > Goring > RA > 5 HS (Four + Fast if fifth HS will ghost).

After Tenstrike: Goring > Goring > RA > RA > Req + 3 HS.

### Phase 4 & Phase 5 - Adds & Golden

Adds is either single target or FoF Goring (Twin) > Goring (Nael) > Goring (Twin) > Goring (Nael) > Req > Goring (Twin) > Goring (Nael) > RA > FoF Goring (Twin) > Goring (Nael) until you win.

Golden Bahamut is just FoF opener and crit while dodging exaflares middle.

  - patch: "6.0"
    description: >-
      * Potency changes across the board as part of Square Enix's re-balancing
      of physical and magical job weapon damages and potencies. All physical
      jobs saw potency deflations of around 25-30%.


      * Relative nerf to Atonement compared to Holy Spirit. This results in dropping an unbuffed Atonement for a 60-second loop instead of a Holy Spirit like in Shadowbringers. This also means that the 4-Atonement loop is deprecated at level 90.


      * New skills, Blade of Faith, Blade of Truth, Blade of Valor combo off of Confiteor and replace the unbuffed Goring Blade in the standard rotation loop.


      * 60-second (now 61-second) rotation loop (i.e. dropping an unbuffed Atonement on every loop) is now the default, since it is slightly better potency in a vacuum, as well as drifting our 30-second oGCDs less.


      * Small regeneration effect on upgraded Sheltron and Intervention, obtained at level 82.


      * Small healing on Holy Spirit and Holy Circle, obtained at level 84. These now proc Divine Veil, so you are no longer completely reliant on your healers to use Divine Veil.


      * Spirits Within loses HP scaling and upgrades to Expiacion at level 86, dealing more damage and also cleaving secondary targets.


      * Divine Veil now heals as well as providing a shield. The Paladin using it remains unaffected.

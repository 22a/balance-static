# Paladin FAQ

> *Why is Circle of Scorn used immediately in the opener?*   

 Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:

* Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime.
* Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.

Circle of Scorn should only be delayed in an optimized setting to line up with buffs and/or for an extra usage in tinctures if it is guaranteed to not lose ticks.

> *Can I use Fight or Flight after Riot Blade to make it easier to fit both Goring Blades?*

Fitting both Goring Blades into each standard FoF window is a high priority, but sacrificing a buffed GCD on a regular basis to make this easier is not a good practice outside of progression, and is only necessary if encounter mechanics force a major disengagement during Fight or Flight. 10 GCD FoF windows are weaker and also limit the optimizations you can do with your rotation, such as fitting 4 Atonements into FoF (bot_spam !faq pld4atone).

Instead, ensure your FoF timing is precise (always in the second half of the GCD cycle, not immediately after the previous GCD) and you aren't double-weaving during FoF with high latency (>100 ms). As long as you keep the GCD rolling, fitting 11 GCDs into FoF with proper timing is always possible at recommended skill speeds, regardless of latency.

> *Should I save oGCDs for Fight or Flight?*

Following a standard opener, every physical oGCD will naturally line up with Fight or Flight if kept on cooldown (but Intervene should usually be stacked and used twice in each FoF window). If downtime misaligns an oGCD with FoF, consider whether delaying the oGCD will cost a usage before the end of the phase. Maximizing oGCD usages is almost always more important than fitting them into buffs.

For optimization, line up Circle of Scorn with multi-target opportunities whenever possible, use Spirits Within earlier in the opener if necessary to avoid lining it up with incoming burst damage, and prioritize keeping uptime with Intervene during movement-heavy mechanics.

> *Should I keep Goring Blade up at all times?*

Goring Blade should be applied every 8 or 9 GCDs in a full-uptime situation to maximize the potency of each usage. However, if downtime will occur immediately after Royal Authority (and cause Atonement usages to be lost), it is usually preferable to skip the previous Goring Blade and use Royal Authority earlier instead, because 3 Atonements are worth more than a Goring Blade combo.

Whenever downtime is involved, case-by-case adjustments to the rotation are recommended to avoid using inefficient Goring Blade combos which would prevent the use of Atonement (if Royal Authority must also be used) or Holy Spirit (if Requiescat is available).

> *I lost uptime/made a mistake. How can I recover the rotation as efficiently as possible?*

Paladin's rotation is deceptively easy to recover. As a general rule, the rotation can be fully reset by each Requiescat window as long as Fight or Flight and Requiescat don't drift apart (even if they must be used sub-optimally). Losses cannot be reversed, but ensuring personal buff windows do not desync from each other will prevent problems from compounding for the rest of the encounter.

**Atone:** For unexpected single-GCD losses, the solution is simple: drop an Atonement so FoF and Requiescat don't get delayed. If the loss occurs during the FoF window, dropping an Atonement will also ensure that the next Goring Blade is still buffed by FoF. The leftover Atonement should then replace a Holy Spirit during the Requiescat window, if possible, due to its higher potency and shorter recast time.

**Goring:** For multiple-GCD losses (broken combos or long disengagements), the solution is to drop a Goring Blade combo at some point before the next Requiescat, because 3 Atonement/Holy Spirit usages are worth more than a full Goring Blade combo, if 3 GCDs must be sacrificed to prevent buff delays. Alternatively, dropping multiple Atonements (or forcing multiple Atonements into Requiescat) with standard Goring Blade timing still works, but is less efficient.

> *Is Holy Spirit affected by Strength (and pots)?*

Yes. Use Strength pots. They affect all of your damage.

> *Should I be holding Atonements for FoF?*

It depends. 

If you are doing the standard 63s rotation (4 Holy Spirits and 6 Atonements every cycle), then it depends. Any lost unbuffed Goring tick is worth 85 potency, and your gain of using an Atonement in FoF over a Riot Blade is only 62.5 potency net. You're ~16% more likely to lose a tick shifting the Atonement into FoF.

If you are doing the 60s rotation (due to fight timings, e.g. Innocence), then the correct drop is a Holy Spirit. Your opener will be standard, but your first unbuffed cycle leading into your second set of buffs should look like this: 

Goring combo > Royal combo > Atonement x2 > Fast > Riot + FoF > Goring > Atonement > Royal combo > Atonement x2 > Goring combo > Atonement > Req > Holy Spirit x3 > Confiteor

Repeat *ad infinitum.* It is preferable to drop a Holy Spirit rather than an unbuffed Atonement; doing so constitutes a gain of roughly 53 potency per minute over dropping an unbuffed Atonement.

> *Why can't I fit both Gorings inside Fight or Flight?*

# Paladin Stats and Materia

**Note:** This priority is also applicable to customizable ("relic") Augmented Law's Order weapons (515) and Blade's weapons (535) for current content, before best-in-slot is obtained, excluding direct hit rate (which cannot be added to these weapons). Use the [Tank Gear Manager](https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make educated gearing and melding decisions with precise stat tiering in mind.

1. Physical Damage (weapon only)
   * Significantly affects all damage dealt
   * Always proportional to item level
   * Cannot be melded

2. Strength
   * Affects all damage dealt
   * Always proportional to item level
   * Cannot be melded

3. Critical Hit
   * Affects critical chance + critical damage
   * Often naturally capped on BiS gear
   * Priority meld (unless number turns red)

4. Skill Speed
   * Reduces physical GCD recast time
   * Meld only to reach preferred GCD speed
   * bot_spam !xivmath rspeed 2.42

5. Direct Hit Rate
   * Affects only direct hit chance
   * Meld remaining slots (filler stat)

6. Determination
   * Sometimes used in one slot due to tiering

7. Tenacity
   * Rarely melded due to weak scaling

# Warrior TEA Tips and Tricks

## Living Liquid Phase

* Rampart seven seconds to prepull to have it last for the first cleave, and to be up for the tank tether later.
  If you facepull and do Inner Chaos, Inner Release, Inner Chaos, you can get the last cleave off in IR before dodging out for the second Protean.
* Shake It Off after you put Storm's Eye up to have it back up for second Protean. Use Thrill of Battle after the first GCD weave to have the buffer from it for the first 2 auto attacks, and then to buff thrill.
* Reprisal after 4th GCD to have it cover the cleave + Cascade
* Use Nascent after the 7th gcd to heal yourself from the cleave 
* We currently get an Adlo spread after the first Cascade.
* You can bait whether LL does fist or high five.  We wanted cleaves and for tanks to be closer for heals, so we bait the limb away from the body, and then the co-tank gap-closes to LL.
* Vengeance after you move the boss for the Embolism. This covers several Jagd Doll explosions, and cleave.  Use Equilibrium here for spot healing.
* If you’re going to Holmgang the Drainage tethers, then do it after the fifth splash.  This will also last into the Cascade cast.
* Once the hand uses the last Hand of Pain, you can stop touching the hand, and focus the boss down.  Use AoE combos while Jagd Dolls are not present! 

## Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser Phase

* During the phase change to BJ/CC, you can save someone’s life with the mitigation from Nascent.
* If Shake is off CD for it, using it for Photon is a solid use, otherwise, use it for the third water explosion + thunder, as you can hit everyone with it. 
* Regardless of if you are going to invuln the double Rocket Punch, or cooldown it, hitting Thrill + Rampart for first lightning swap is a very powerful use, and can cover lots of autos, plus incidental damage
* Vengeance on the Flarethrower covers that, several autos, and the Whirlwind and is the best use.
* Use Equilibrium and Nascent as needed, try your best to fit harder-hitting attacks into Nascent, this will ease a lot of burden on your healers.

## Alexander Prime Phase

* If you push BJ/CC, just hold your IR until after Inception.
* This phase varies greatly with every group strat, but having a tank bait the BJ jump in Inception makes it very consistent.

## Perfect Alexander Phase

* You have enough time to get 9 gcds off before Stillness. (Using a 2.36 GCD)
* You can get four IRs into the phase.  If you have a  WHM, it’s better for you to get jailed sooner, and let them get more glares off.  After your last IR and any Infuriate charges, you’re a wet noodle. 
* You can time Holmgang to cover the entirety of a buster series, but the timing is tight.  If you wait one second after the lasers fly into the air and hit Holmgang, it will catch them all.  This is also risky as hell, so just mitigate the first hit solo then Holmgang, as it’s far more consistent.

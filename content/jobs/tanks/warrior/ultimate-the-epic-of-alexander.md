# Warrior TEA tips and tricks

## Living Liquid
- Rampart 7s prepull to have it last for first cleave, and be up for the tank tether later
If you facepull, and do IC IR IC, you can get the last cleave off in IR before dodging out in 2nd Protean.
- Shake after you put eye up to have it back up for 2nd Protean. Use thrill after the first gcd weave to have the buffer from it for the first 2 auto attacks, and then to buff thrill.
- Reprisal after 4th gcd to have it cover the cleave + cascade
- Use Nascent after the 7th gcd to heal yourself from the cleave 
- We currently get an adlo spread after the first cascade.
- You can bait whether LL does fist or high five.  We wanted cleaves and for tanks to be closer for heals, so we bait the limb away from the body, and the my co-tank gapcloses to LL.
- Vengeance after you move the boss for the Embolism, this covers several jagd doll explosions, and cleave.  Use Equilibrium here for spot heal.
- If you’re going to holmgang the drainage tethers, then do it after the 5th splash.  This will also last into the cascade cast.
- Once the hand uses the last hand of pain, you can stop touching the hand, and focus the boss down.  Use aoe combos while Jagd dolls are not present! 




## Bruise phase
- During the phase change to BJ/CC, you can save someone’s life with the mitigation from nascent
- If shake is off cd for it, using it for photon is a solid use, otherwise, i’m using it for the 3rd water explosion + thunder, you can hit everyone with it. 
- Regardless of if you are going to invuln the double rocket punch, or cooldown it, hitting thrill + rampart for first lightning swap is a very powerful use, and can cover lots of autos + incidental damage
- Vengeance on the flarethrower covers that, several autos, and the whirlwind and is the best use I have found so far
- Use equilibrium and nascent as needed, try your best to fit harder hitting attacks into Nascent, this will ease a lot of burden on your healers.


## Alex phase
- If you push BJ/CC, just hold your IR until after inception.
- This phase varies greatly with every group strat, but having a tank bait the BJ jump in inception made it very consistent for us.


## Perfect phase
- You have enough time to get 9 gcd’s off before stillness, if you’re not pepega.  (I also use 2.36 gcd)
- You can get 4 IR’s into the phase.  If you have a whm, it’s better for you to get jailed sooner, and let them get more glares off.  After your last IR and any infuriate charges, you’re a wet noodle.  I have a vod on my twitch of how to do 1st jail IR.
- You can time holmgang to cover the entirety of a buster series, but the timing is tight.  If you wait 1 second after the lasers fly into the air and hit holmgang, it will catch them all.  This is also risky as hell, so just mitigate the first hit solo then holmgang, it’s far more consistent.

# Warrior Stats and Materia

With access to the information we know now, utilizing community tools such as the current [Tank DPS calculator](https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) allows us to more accurately determine what gear and melds should be used.

For Stat Tiers, refer to [TheoryJerks/AkhMorning’s website.](http://theoryjerks.akhmorning.com/stats/speed/)

## Melding priority

Crit > Comfy SkS > Det > Ten

Direct Hit is avoided altogether because of how Inner Chaos and Inner Release work: Direct Hit has no effect in either of those.

Currently “Supported” **Skill Speed Tiers**

* 1015 for 2.43 GCD - Highest DPS, but requires some planning
* 1117 for 2.42 GCD - Some breathing room compared to the one above
* 1523 for 2.38 GCD - Your average Warrior skill speed
* 1624 for 2.37 GCD - Some breathing room for mechs and clipping
* 1726 for 2.36 GCD - "Greeding Mechanics" levels of comfy

The difference between 2.43 GCD and 2.38 GCD is a single weapon skill between Inner Releases:

Inner Release’s recast: 90 seconds
 <br> Weapon skill timer: 2.43 seconds or 2.38 seconds

Total amount of Weapon skills per 90 seconds:

90s / 2.43 = 37.037… which translates into 37 full Weapon skills
 <br> 90s / 2.38 = 37.815… which translates into 38 full Weapon skills

> "Comfy"?

Some fights require extra skill speed to hit that last skill before a mechanic. One example would be E3s where you can hit Path (80 gauge) right before the first downtime.

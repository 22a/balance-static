> *Lv70: Single Target vs AoE (2 targets) ?*

<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRqxeKcJJb0zc2Kh86mY222FLkV9r8YAByW-TzoPujokBy1DT4ofPlwpFhKN4K4uZWhrYLfHvo7Lz5g/pubhtml>
TLDR: very equal but lv70 ST wins by a small margin


> *how do I relic*

- Cap Crit, cap Det
- Check if you can replace any SkS melds in your gear with Det
- Get any missing SkS through relic
- Fill the rest of the relic with Tnc


> *How do I Upheaval?*

All the time  
I'm using Inner Release's recast timer as a visual guide whether to hit Upheaval or not.
Hit Upheaval at:  
-88s  
-58s  
-28s  

Because Upheaval drifts a bit, aim to hit Upheaval at:  
-88~85   
-58~53  
-28~22  

If your 3rd Upheaval (per 90s timeframe) slipped out of the 22s, either skip it completely or replace it with Onslaught, depending on your preference and gauge needs


> *What is wrong with my log?? How do I improve?*

"Things to do when I read a log that most people can't be bothered to check", by Sizzy  

First you check IR windows, just toss the log into xiva and see what it tells you <https://xivanalysis.com/>

Second I like to check gcd's outside of eye buff. you can do this by 
selecting your name -> Damage done -> Events > Click the eye button twice, until it gets a red outline. Make sure to discount the first 3 gcd's that you apply eye.

You can always take a log and compare it to another log of a high % player (remember to adjust killtime to be the same). Compare your casts with theirs and it should give you an idea of lost uptime and rotational mistakes

Next thing I like to check is how your IR aligns with raid buffs. You can do this by doing the same thing as above, but clicking the IR icon once instead. On the right hand side, it'll show what buffs were active when you landed your attacks. 

Last thing I like to do, and this is the thing people hate doing, is go to 
Casts -> timelines
To check for errors in the rotation. Is eye refreshed properly? Are upheavals and IC's going in trick? Do you lose path casts? too many onslaughts? etc

# Stat Priority

1. Item Level

   * Affects Strength and Weapon Damage (for weapons)
   * Significantly affects all damage dealt
   * Prioritize over substat type
2. Critical Hit

   * Priority meld on all gear (unless already capped on that piece)
3. Skill Speed

   * Meld only to reach preferred GCD speed (enough to consistently get 5 GCDs in Blood Weapon)
   * \#bot_spam !xivmath rspeed 2.43 or see the tiers below
4. Direct Hit Rate

   * Meld remaining slots (filler stat)
5. Determination

   * Sometimes used in one slot due to tiering
   * Rarely melded due to weak scaling

When choosing gear or melds before reaching best in slot (BiS) sets, it  is generally best to follow the priority list above.  The [gear planner](https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) can be used to compare specific gear sets and find the cases where you may want to ignore the priority.

## Skill Speed (SkS) Tiers

* 2.43s GCD - 1015 SkS (A bit tight for some people)
* 2.42s GCD - 1117 SkS
* 2.41s GCD - 1218 SkS
* 2.40s GCD - 1320 SkS
* 2.39s GCD - 1421 SkS
* 2.38s GCD - 1523 SkS (Quite lenient)

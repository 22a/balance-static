title: Openers and Rotation

Openers
DRK has a several different options for openers, not all of which are listed here.
Fight timings and party composition can both affect which opener is best, based on when you can keep uptime on the boss and when raid buffs are used.
Fight-specific opener information can be found in #drk_encounter and #drk_questions (often in the pins).
This section will list some General-purpose DRK openers which work relatively well in most situations.
 
:strpot: Tanks currently use Grade 4 Tinctures of Strength :hq: 
(Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)
 

Best raid buff alignment and a good default choice
 

Useful if a fight benefits from a slightly earlier :Delirium: Delirium due to downtime or phasing
 
Single Weave Opener

Use only if your ping prevents you from double weaving without clipping (delaying your next GCD), and you have exhausted options such as VPNs (!faq vpn in bot_spam).
 
Rotation
 
DRK's rotation after the opener is deceptively simple:
:blank:·  Avoid overcapping on MP or blood, by using  :EdgeofShadow: Edge of Shadow and :BS: Bloodspiller, respectively.
:blank:·  use other damaging oGCDs (such as :AD: Abyssal Drain, :Salted: Salted Earth, :BW: Blood Weapon, and :Delirium: Delirium) on cooldown. (Your second Blood Weapon (around 1:00) can [and should] be delayed by ~3 GCDs to avoid overcapping mana/blood before raidbuffs.)
:blank:·  fill your remaining GCDs with the  :SE: Souleater combo ( :HS: Hard Slash -> :SS: Syphon Strike -> :SE: Souleater)

No-prepull :TBN: The Blackest Night Opener

If a fight does low enough damage that your prepull :TBN: The Blackest Night (TBN) won't break, consider using this opener, which loses 600-800 MP to overcapping before the first :EdgeofShadow: Edge of Shadow is used. Other ways of avoiding prepull TBN exist, but this one is simple and has fairly minimal loss.
 
 
Unmend Opener
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583964695266983944/875130705905078313/unmend-5.x.png
This opener should only be used if you need precise positioning on a boss early into the fight and can't do that with a standard (facepull) opener, as it delays :LivingShadow: Living Shadow out of raid buffs, as well as delaying your MP generation.
Consider having the other tank pull instead, then :provoke: Provoke from them if needed.

 
:DRKQ_2: Why is :TBN:  The Blackest Night (TBN) used pre-pull in the opener?
:DRKA_2: This prevents overcapping MP from having :BW:  Blood Weapon  on Hard Slash and from a possible natural MP tick.
 
:DRKQ_2: How do I spend my MP?
:DRKA_2: As a general rule, never overcap MP, and consider holding on to 3k MP so that you can use :TBN: The Blackest Night (TBN) if needed.

If you have raid buffs and are optimizing, you should plan to use all of your :EdgeofShadow: Edge of Shadow (EoS) casts under buffs, and in particular, to put more EoS casts where buffs are stronger. This often means using five EoS under even-minute (0, 2, 4, ...) buffs, and three under odd-minute buffs.
 
:DRKQ_2: Should I always pair :BW: Blood Weapon and :Delirium: Delirium?
:DRKA_2: No. You should be using both abilities as they come up unless downtime will cause you to lose several GCDs in them (or other unusual circumstances).  They will come up together every 3 minutes in full uptime (and can overlap when that happens, as long as they are not weaved between the same pair of GCDs).
 
:DRKQ_2: At how many targets do I use my Area of Effect (AoE) skills?
:DRKA_2: At any number of targets, use :LivingShadow: Living Shadow when possible.
At 2+ targets:
:blank:·  Replace :EdgeofShadow: Edge of Shadow with :FloodofShadow: Flood of Shadow
:blank:·  Replace :SE: Souleater combo with :StalwartSoul:  Stalwart Soul combo
At 3+ targets:
:blank:·  Replace :BS: Bloodspiller with :Quietus: Quietus

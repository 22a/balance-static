# Introduction

First off, a word of warning: **Do not use the gear given out by the first job quest.** It is normal-quality, meaning it is significantly weaker than other gear of the same item level. The Steel Cuirass (ilvl30), for example, has about the same defense as a high-quality Iron Scale Mail (ilvl 23).

While this guide is not intended as a complete resource for tanking in dungeons, the following section will provide a brief primer for those new to the role. Feel free to skip ahead to the last section, which provides a rundown of how the leveling process affects your rotation, if you are already familiar with tanking in dungeons.

# General Tips

\- Keep Grit active at all times in dungeons. This multiplies all of your enmity generation by ten, allowing you to keep the attention of enemies you damage. Entering a duty which syncs your level down will toggle Grit off if it was already on, so make sure the icon is present in your list of buffs before proceeding.

\- Unless you are engaging a single enemy, make sure to grab the attention of all enemies you plan to fight at once. Even if there are only a couple enemies present, or if one enemy needs to be singled out to kill first, it's usually best to hit a couple AoE actions to firmly establish threat on everything before switching to single-target.

\- Rotate through your defensive cooldowns. Large groups of "trash" mobs usually deal significantly more damage than bosses do, so don't be afraid to use all of your mitigation to get through a pull. In addition to Rampart, Shadow Wall, and The Blackest Night (TBN), remember to cycle through Reprisal and Arm's Length in your defensive rotation. Note that "slow" in the description of Arm's Length means an attack speed reduction ("heavy" is a movement speed reduction), so it will inflict a significant debuff to all mobs which attack you. Note that this is ineffective on almost all bosses.

\- Try to keep moving until you have gathered up all the enemies you wish to pull at once, and then stay in one spot until they are all dead. Many jobs have ground-targeted AoE abilities which will heal you or damage enemies and which cannot be moved after being placed. Players also regenerate HP and mana much more quickly while not in combat, so bringing stragglers over to the next group can potentially cause your healer to run out of mana.

\- Don't be afraid to pull more than one group at once. Even in very low-level dungeons, your AoE damage output is quite high and can make up for some party members lacking AoE actions entirely. Healing actions are also relatively strong at low levels, so it takes an extremely large group of enemies to outpace your healer's ability.





#### 1-25

notes in case you get synced

Unleash on 2

#### 26+

SE combo on 2, potency-neutral, but has healing

#### 30+

Flood on 1+\
SE combo now pulls ahead in potency on 2

#### 35+

Blood Weapon

#### 40+

Edge on 1, Flood on 2+

#### 56+

Abyssal Drain: use primarily for healing

#### 62+

Bloodspiller: use on up to 3; potency-neutral at 4, but loss of spiller on next single-target phase is bad

#### 64+

Quietus: use on 3+

#### 68+

Delirium: can be used for 5hit BW

#### 70+

TBN: DRK becomes a real person

Your mana generation rate roughly matches TBN cost, so dump mana at the start of pulls and then use on CD

#### 72+

Stalwart combo on 2

5hit BW can be achieved with 100 blood->unleash->BW->quietus->quietus->stalwart->quietus->unleash

#### 80

Living Shadow is the most efficient AoE blood spender by far. Worth using if it literally only gets one hit off in a vacuum; actual worth decided by how efficient your next use can be

\- always grab aggro with aoe

#### 1-25

notes in case you get synced

Unleash on 2

#### 26+

SE combo on 2, potency-neutral, but has healing

#### 30+

Flood on 1+\
SE combo now pulls ahead in potency on 2

#### 35+

Blood Weapon

#### 40+

Edge on 1, Flood on 2+

#### 56+

Abyssal Drain: use primarily for healing

#### 62+

Bloodspiller: use on up to 3; potency-neutral at 4, but loss of spiller on next single-target phase is bad

#### 64+

Quietus: use on 3+

#### 72+

Stalwart combo on 2

#### 80

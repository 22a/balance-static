Dark Knight features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in APM and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, able to put many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows. It also has access to one of the most powerful single-target mitigation abilities available in The Blackest Night (TBN).

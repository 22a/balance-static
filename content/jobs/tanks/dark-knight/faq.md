  - question: Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon?
    answer: >-
      There are several possible reasons. Below are some ways to diagnose common
      issues:

      * Try (on a striking dummy) using Blood Weapon immediately before your first GCD (the GCD will be slightly delayed by animation lock from Blood Weapon). If this makes a five-GCD Blood Weapon reliable, your problem is likely that you are using Blood Weapon too early under normal circumstances. Ideally, Blood Weapon should be used so that its animation lock ends exactly as you press the next GCD, around two-thirds to three-fourths of the way through the GCD.

      * Try (on a striking dummy) using Blood Weapon at your usual timing between GCDs, but use no other oGCDs. Repeatedly press each upcoming GCD until it activates. If this makes a five-GCD Blood Weapon reliable, your problem may be that you are delaying your GCDs under Blood Weapon, either by using too many oGCDs between GCDs (more than two, or more than one if your GCD speed and ping are particularly high) or by not activating your GCDs fast enough after the previous one.

      * If neither of these fix your problem, you may need additional skill speed in order to get five GCDs under Blood Weapon. Using a VPN may also help by mitigating your latency (and therefore also reducing animation lock).
  - question: How do I spend my MP?
    answer: >-
      As a general rule, never overcap MP, and consider maintaining at least
      3000 MP so that you can use The Blackest Night if needed.


      When optimizing, you should plan to use all of your Edge of Shadow (EoS) casts under buffs, and in particular, to put more EoS casts where buffs are stronger. This often means using five EoS under even-minute (0, 2, 4, ...) buffs, and three under odd-minute buffs.
  - question: Can I overlap Blood Weapon and Delirium?
    answer: Yes, although you need to be careful to not overcap on Blood, as
      Delirium prevents you from spending Blood with Bloodspiller until all
      three of its stacks have been used. With typical alignments of Blood
      Weapon and Delirium, you can accomplish this by making sure that you are
      at 40 Blood or less before pressing Blood Weapon or Delirium, whichever
      comes first.
  - question: Why are The Blackest Night and Blood Weapon used pre-pull in the opener?
    answer: Living Shadow plays a long animation (around 6.8s) before it begins
      doing damage, and so in order to get as many hits as possible of this
      strong ability under buffs, it needs to be used as early as possible in
      the opener. By using Blood Weapon prepull, we can get Living Shadow out
      after 3 GCDs. Using The Blackest Night before Blood Weapon then prevents
      overcapping MP from Blood Weapon on Hard Slash, and from a possible
      natural MP tick prior to the first Edge of Shadow.
  - question: At how many targets do I use my Area of Effect (AoE) skills?
    answer: |-
      At any number of targets, use Living Shadow when possible.

      At two or more targets:
      * Replace Souleater combo with Stalwart Soul combo

      At three or more targets:
      * Replace Bloodspiller with Quietus
      * Replace Edge of Shadow with Flood of Shadow

      At four or more targets:
      * Replace Carve and Spit with Abyssal Drain

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon (or Delirium)?

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon. It is possible to mitigate some latency by using a gaming VPN (for example, Mudfish or PingZapper).

# I’m disengaging from the boss, should I use Unmend?

Generally no. Breaking a combo by using Unmend in the middle of it is a bigger loss than waiting to get back to the boss. You can safely Unmend if you are leaving the boss for long enough that your combo would drop anyway (15s or roughly six GCDs), or if you are between combos and disengaging for at least one full GCD.

# Should I hold Blood Weapon for Delirium? Should I hold Delirium for Blood Weapon?

No. There is no inherent synergy between Blood Weapon and Delirium—Blood Weapon will always give 3000 MP and 50 Blood, regardless of if you use Delirium at the same time. Unless you know your kill-time and that holding one or the other will not lose a usage, do not hold either Blood Weapon or Delirium.

# General Tips

Eden's Promise features a number of mechanics that apply damage down on failure, with failure determined as the mechanic causing damage to your HP bar. Because of this condition, it is possible to negate the damage downs by absorbing the entire hit with a shield such as TBN.

The mechanics where this is most commonly useful are:

E9S: Anti-Air Phaser Unlimited ("AA Chariot")

E10S: Throne of Shadow ("Doggo Standup" / "Sword Chariot")

E11S: Turn of the Heavens ("Downtime Red" / "Brightfire"), Burnout ("Lightning Burnt Strike")

All four of these AoEs are magical with absolute maximum damage rolls of approximately 89k, 78k, 81k, and 80k, respectively.

At BiS, a non-exhaustive list of safe combinations for Anti-Air include TBN plus: 

* 20%+10%+10%+10%
* 20%+20%+10%
* 30%+10%+10%
* 30%+15%

(41.7%, 42.4%, 43.3%, and 40.5% total mitigation, respectively) 

Safe combinations for Throne of Shadow, Turn of the Heavens, and Burnout include TBN plus:

* 20%+10%+10%
* 20%+20% (20%+15% also works for Throne only)
* 30%+10%

(35.2%, 36%/32%, and 37% total mitigation, respectively)

 If you are not BiS but your max HP is around 200k or higher, you can add an extra source of 10% or swap out one of the listed mitigations with one of a higher tier (20% instead of 10/15%, or 30% instead of 20%). If you are running with the Echo enabled, you can do the reverse operation, removing one source of 10% mitigation or downgrading one mitigation to the next-lowest tier.

Zeroing these AoEs out with less than 200k HP requires even more investment and is likely not worth it. Note that all of these combinations err on the side of safety. You will very often avoid a damage down with less mitigation, but that doesn't mean you're safe from a max damage roll. Your TBN should naturally break from the follow-up tankbuster or Protean after Anti-Air Phaser and Turn of the Heavens, respectively; you must have aggro in order for your TBN to break after Throne of Shadow and Burnout via auto-attacks.

The AoE at the end of Wide Angle Phaser seems identical to the one at the start of Anti-Air, but hits significantly harder (close to 110k max) and trying to zero it out is not recommended. Cataclysm ("Apoc jump") in Phase 2 of E12S can also be zeroed out, but there is no followup damage and the lost Edge of Shadow will more than outweigh any uptime gained. 

# E9S

Your second use of Delirium will occur during the first Phaser mechanic. If you aren't confident in perfectly rolling your GCD here, you can shift Delirium forward or backward by one GCD in your opener so that this use occurs after a completed Souleater combo and finishes before the final boss-centered AoE hits.

The first hit of Anti-Air can be zeroed out as detailed above. Note that you may not have room to do this, depending on the strategy; either both tanks must stack together and invuln the circular tankbusters, or both party stacks need to be in the same corner so that the tanks can take the center and the opposite corner. A PLD co-tank may also be able to give you room if their Requiescat window lines up with the mechanic.

Using Rampart as the large circle AoE indicators flash after brambles will allow it to last through the following Phaser while also being available to use again for the Devouring Dark at the end of the phase.

# E10S

Throne of Shadow can be zeroed out for uptime, as detailed above. If you do so, use your mitigation late so that it lasts through the following Umbra Smash.

If you are not planning to zero out the first Throne of Shadow, pulling with Unmend may gain a GCD in the phase. Do this if you aren't confident on getting the last Souleater as the boss stands up.

Darkness Unleashed (the possible stack mechanic following Umbra Smash) can be taken solo by using most or all of your mitigation. Ask your healers if they would prefer this versus having to heal the whole raid.

For Shadow Cleave, instead of disengaging to place your clone far away from the boss, you can instead stay at melee range and then run through to the opposite side of the hitbox to avoid being targeted by your own clone.

# E11S

Pulling without Unmend is highly recommended, as your second Living Shadow will just barely finish before the first intermission. Any delay will ensure that the last hit gets ghosted or completely lost. At 2.43 GCD, this may happen regardless.

A very early plunge will enable it to be used to re-engage after a Lightning Burnt Strike if desired.

TBN can be used for both hits of Powder Mark if used just before or at the start of the cast. Rampart will cover both hits if used late in the cast.

If buffs are delayed to 4:30, open with a prepull potion and early Delirium. You will also need to use an extra Edge of Shadow out of buffs to keep Darkside active.

Use Delirium on the 3rd GCD after Sundered Sky at the latest to finish the following use before Prismatic Deception. This Delirium should be used if your total killtime will fall between 9:40~10:45, or longer than 11:15. Otherwise, it can be held to use directly after Prismatic for better alignment with raid buffs.

At the Right of the Heavens just before Prismatic Deception, it is possible to stand opposite the party stack and run through the boss after Powder Mark snapshots. The timing on this is quite tight.

You will gain about 200 mana during Shifting Sky, 2200 during Sundered Sky, and 3200 during Prismatic Deception, so plan accordingly.

# E12S Phase 1

Dark Missionary can cover both the Diamond Dust casts and the light party stack markers if used late in the cast. It can also cover both the background laser and the following Maleficium just before the Classical Sculptures.

# E12S Phase 2

Remember to hold your 60-second cooldowns, including Blood Weapon, until after the Darkest Dance knockback early on in the fight.

Allow yourself to overcap 10 blood before the Basic Relativity stun. This lets you finish your last Souleater combo and get an extra Unmend as you run out to bait your hourglass. It also allows you to precast Living Shadow, which will will be stunned during its startup animation but will not lose any attacks because of the short duration.

It is possible to hit a GCD as you are knocked through the boss during Basic Relativity. Use Plunge by the third GCD at the latest in order to use it again to follow the boss during Singular Apocalypse.

Hold your third Delirium use to align with Trick Attack, and/or to avoid losing hits as the boss jumps for Darkest Dance. You can afford to drift Delirium by about 20 seconds total before Advanced Relativity.

Do *not* precast Living Shadow at Intermediate Relativity, as the stun will last past its startup phase and cause it to lose attacks.

You will gain about 2600 mana during Advanced Relativity, so plan accordingly.

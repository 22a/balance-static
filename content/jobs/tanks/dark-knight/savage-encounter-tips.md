NOTES

# E9S

\- 3rd gcd delirium to line up with wide angle

\- use cover if pld exists

\- rampart at bramble flash and it will cover phaser + be up for buster

All three of these AoEs are magical with absolute maximum damage rolls of approximately 89k, 78k, and 81k, respectively. As the damage downs associated with these mechanics will only apply when you take damage to your HP bar, you can negate them by absorbing the entire hit with a shield.

At BiS, a non-exhaustive list of safe combinations for Anti-Air include TBN plus: 20%+10%+10%+10% or 20%+20%+10% or 30%+10%+10% or 30%+15% (41.7%, 42.4%, 43.3%, and 40.5% total mitigation, respectively) 

Safe combinations for Throne of Shadow and Turn of the Heavens include: 20%+10%+10% or 20%+20% (20%+15% also works for Throne only) or 30%+10% (35.2%, 36%/32%, and 37% total mitigation, respectively)

 If you are not BiS but your max HP is around 200k or higher, you can add an extra source of 10% or swap out one of the listed mitigations with one of a higher tier (20% instead of 10/15%, or 30% instead of 20%).

Zeroing these AoEs out with less than 200k HP requires even more investment and is likely not worth it. Note that all of these combinations err on the side of safety. You will very often avoid a damage down with less mitigation, but that doesn't mean you're safe from a max damage roll. Your TBN should naturally break from the followup tankbuster or protean after Anti-Air Phaser and Turn of the Heavens, respectively; you must have aggro in order for your TBN to break after Throne of Shadow.

The AoE at the end of Wide Angle Phaser seems identical to the one at the start of Anti-Air, but hits significantly harder (close to 110k max) and trying to zero it out is not recommended. Using Rampart when the large AoE circles flash at first brambles in E9S will allow it to last through the first phaser and be up again for the tankbuster after the second phaser if applicable. Using your mitigation late in E10S and E11S will allow it to cover the following tankbusters. 

# E10S

\- unmend may gain a gcd

\- zero out standups

\- you can kitchen sink the stack

\- for shadow cleaver stay melee and run through the boss

# E11S

\- Facepull opener is a MUST

\- Can very early plunge for first burnt strike thunder

\- Rampart covers both hits of Powder Mark, can TBN twice as well

\- Uptime powder mark stuff

\- Delirium timings vs killtime

\- Check mana gen at downtimes

# E12S-1

\- Shiva uptime stuff

# E12S-2

\- Hold third delirium like 10 seconds for Trick

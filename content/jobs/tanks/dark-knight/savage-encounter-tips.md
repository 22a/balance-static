# General Tips

Eden's Promise features a number of mechanics that apply damage down on failure, as determined by causing damage to your HP bar. Because of this condition, it is possible to negate the damage downs by absorbing the entire hit with a shield such as TBN.

The mechanics where this is most commonly useful are:

E9S: Anti-Air Phaser Unlimited ("AA Chariot")

E10S: Throne of Shadow ("Doggo Standup" / "Sword Chariot")

E11S: Turn of the Heavens ("Downtime Red" / "Brightfire"), Burnout ("Lightning Burnt Strike")

All four of these AoEs are magical with absolute maximum damage rolls of approximately 89k, 78k, 81k, and 80k, respectively.

At BiS, a non-exhaustive list of safe combinations for Anti-Air include TBN plus: 

*  20%+10%+10%+10%
*  20%+20%+10%
*  30%+10%+10%
*  30%+15%

(41.7%, 42.4%, 43.3%, and 40.5% total mitigation, respectively) 

Safe combinations for Throne of Shadow, Turn of the Heavens, and Burnout include TBN plus:

* 20%+10%+10%
* 20%+20% (20%+15% also works for Throne only)
* 30%+10%

(35.2%, 36%/32%, and 37% total mitigation, respectively)

 If you are not BiS but your max HP is around 200k or higher, you can add an extra source of 10% or swap out one of the listed mitigations with one of a higher tier (20% instead of 10/15%, or 30% instead of 20%). If you are running with the Echo enabled, you can do the reverse operation, removing one source of 10% mitigation or downgrading one mitigation to the next-lowest tier.

Zeroing these AoEs out with less than 200k HP requires even more investment and is likely not worth it. Note that all of these combinations err on the side of safety. You will very often avoid a damage down with less mitigation, but that doesn't mean you're safe from a max damage roll. Your TBN should naturally break from the followup tankbuster or protean after Anti-Air Phaser and Turn of the Heavens, respectively; you must have aggro in order for your TBN to break after Throne of Shadow and Burnout via auto-attacks.

The AoE at the end of Wide Angle Phaser seems identical to the one at the start of Anti-Air, but hits significantly harder (close to 110k max) and trying to zero it out is not recommended. Cataclysm ("Apoc jump") in Phase 2 of E12S can also be zeroed out, but there is no followup damage and the lost Edge of Shadow will more than outweigh any uptime gained. 

# E9S

Your second use of Delirium will occur during the first Phaser mechanic. If you aren't confident in perfectly rolling your GCD here, you can shift Delirium forward or backward by one GCD in your opener so that this use occurs after a completed Souleater combo and finishes before the final boss-centered AoE hits.

The first hit of Anti-Air can be zeroed out as detailed above. Note that you may not have room to do this, depending on the strategy; either both tanks must stack together and invuln the circular tankbusters, or both party stacks need to be in the same corner so that the tanks can take the center and the opposite corner. A PLD cotank may also be able to give you room if their Requiescat window lines up with the mechanic.

Using Rampart as the large circle AoE indicators flash after brambles will allow it to last through the following Phaser while also 





The major concern for this encounter is the possible downtime caused by Wide-Angle and Anti-Air Phasers. If you aren't confident in being able to perfectly roll your GCD while avoiding the boss-centered AoE at the end of Wide-Angle Phaser, you can try moving Delirium forward or back by one GCD in your opener so that the second use comes after a full Souleater combo and the last hit finishes before running out.

You can easily keep full uptime during Anti-Air Phaser by taking zero damage from the first boss-centered AoE. This AoE deals about 89k magic damage on a maximum roll; at BiS, this means TBN plus at least 40% total mitigation without Echo or 32% mitigation with Echo. Combinations for the former include 20%+20%+10%, 30%+20%, and 30%+10%+10%. Combinations for the latter include

All three of these AoEs are magical with absolute maximum damage rolls of approximately 89k, 78k, 80k, and 81k, respectively. As the damage downs associated with these mechanics will only apply when you take damage to your HP bar, you can negate them by absorbing the entire hit with a shield.

At BiS, a non-exhaustive list of safe combinations for Anti-Air include TBN plus: 20%+10%+10%+10% or 20%+20%+10% or 30%+10%+10% or 30%+15% (41.7%, 42.4%, 43.3%, and 40.5% total mitigation, respectively) 

Safe combinations for Throne of Shadow and Turn of the Heavens include: 20%+10%+10% or 20%+20% (20%+15% also works for Throne only) or 30%+10% (35.2%, 36%/32%, and 37% total mitigation, respectively)

 If you are not BiS but your max HP is around 200k or higher, you can add an extra source of 10% or swap out one of the listed mitigations with one of a higher tier (20% instead of 10/15%, or 30% instead of 20%).

Zeroing these AoEs out with less than 200k HP requires even more investment and is likely not worth it. Note that all of these combinations err on the side of safety. You will very often avoid a damage down with less mitigation, but that doesn't mean you're safe from a max damage roll. Your TBN should naturally break from the followup tankbuster or protean after Anti-Air Phaser and Turn of the Heavens, respectively; you must have aggro in order for your TBN to break after Throne of Shadow.

The AoE at the end of Wide Angle Phaser seems identical to the one at the start of Anti-Air, but hits significantly harder (close to 110k max) and trying to zero it out is not recommended. Using Rampart when the large AoE circles flash at first brambles in E9S will allow it to last through the first phaser and be up again for the tankbuster after the second phaser if applicable. Using your mitigation late in E10S and E11S will allow it to cover the following tankbusters. 

# E10S

\- unmend may gain a gcd

\- zero out standups

\- you can kitchen sink the stack

\- for shadow cleaver stay melee and run through the boss

# E11S

\- Facepull opener is a MUST

\- Can very early plunge for first burnt strike thunder

\- Rampart covers both hits of Powder Mark, can TBN twice as well

\- Uptime powder mark stuff

\- Delirium timings vs killtime

\- Check mana gen at downtimes

# E12S-1

\- Shiva uptime stuff

# E12S-2

\- Hold third delirium like 10 seconds for Trick





* First BW after knockback
* LS at basic downtime (when hourglass explodes), may overcap 10 blood but it's worth
* Mash GCD during Basic
* Either use plunge after 3rd gcd absolute latest or do superior walk in really quickly strat https://streamable.com/w1obs4
* Delirium can drift around 20s, delay third use for trick or just after apoc jumps

# The Weapon's Refrain

## Best-in-slot

For level 70 ultimates, a full set of synced gear with critical hit + determination and enough pieces with critical hit + skill speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 470 or higher will max out both substats in UWU. The last- and second-to-last steps of the Bozjan Resistance weapons are a major damage boost, as they allow you to hit the cap for multiple stats. The maximum sync value for weapons is 318 in each substat.

Use the most current food available. Any grade Tincture of Strength will grant the maximum benefit in UWU. 

If you wish to minmax further, a non-exhaustive list of best-in-slot configurations will be listed below. You can find a complete list in the dedicated best-in-slot guide for DRK.

## Offensive Cooldown Usage

Optimizing your damage on Dark Knight revolves heavily around shifting your potency skills into raidbuffs, and ultimates are no different. For best results, coordinate with your group to know when burst windows are occurring. Generally speaking, they will fall at the start of each phase, plus some time in the middle of each. For more detailed guidelines, see the sections below and consult with your group.

## Phase-by-phase optimization

### Garuda

Your opener should be similar to the level 80 opener with a few key adjustments. The main considerations are a very early Plunge, delayed Blood Weapon due to lack of Living Shadow, and delayed Abyssal Drain and Salted Earth to take advantage of plumes. An example MT opener is listed below: \

Plunge, Unmend, and facepull openers are all viable. The most important consideration is which one best allows both you and your fellow melee players to keep your GCDs rolling, as Garuda's small size and rapid movement can easily eat your inputs. Consider as well whether you gain a use of Plunge overall vs holding it for raidbuffs. The strength tincture, Rampart, and Salted Earth uses are timed so that they will be active while plumes are out and expire before Garuda jumps away.

The very early Plunge use allows a second use before Garuda jumps away after the first set of plumes. This then allows the third use to occur before she jumps away after Frictions, which in turn allows you to Plunge back onto the boss after blocking one of the double Mistral Songs.

Holding Delirium for plumes is not recommended. While this will naturally align with both sets of plumes, the extra AoE damage is typically not needed and comes at a cost of damage on the boss. You may even choose to cut out the Quietus from the example opener, as it may not be needed.

If you are not pulling Garuda, using Dark Mind to mitigate the Mistral Song will allow you to cover both hits from the Spiny Plume with Rampart+ Shadow Wall. Combined with Abyssal Drain's multi-target healing, this will considerably ease the healing burden. Your second use of Abyssal Drain can then be held until the second set of plumes, and the third to hit Ifrit and both front nails.

Plan your Reprisal uses with your cotank. Ideally, one tank should cover the Friction casts, and the other should hit the following Aerial Blast.

The second set of plumes come with quite a bit of damage on the main tank, so make sure to give them a shield with The Blackest Night (TBN) if you are not holding the boss.

You should ensure that you get a second use of Delirium during the phase. If your killtime is too fast to allow a full use at the end, move your first use earlier in your opener.

### Ifrit

It is possible to keep your combo rolling from Garuda's death to Ifrit's reappearance. However, this is a *very* tight window, so only try it if you're confident.

Discuss with your group whether you are making an effort to skip the dashes near the end of the phase or not. This means holding your tincture plus any major cooldowns Doing so means holding your potion 

If you are holding the boss during the nail phase, you can hit three targets with Flood of Darkness by targeting one nail and moving onto the hitbox of the other.

Nail phase is another period of heavy tank damage, so make sure the tank holding the boss gets a TBN. Use a defensive cooldown as well if you are holding Ifrit. Ideally, the tank with aggro during and after nail phase should avoid pulling Titan so that they can freely use their cooldowns during Ifrit. TBN is also valuable for Flaming Crush + autoattack damage.

### Titan

If Plunge is available when Titan first becomes targetable, you can use it immediately and have it back up after the Upheaval knockback. Otherwise, hold it in the opener for that purpose.

# The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)

## Best-in-slot

For level 70 ultimates, a full set of synced gear with critical hit + determination and enough pieces with critical hit + skill speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 470 or higher will max out both substats in UWU. The last- and second-to-last steps of the Bozjan Resistance weapons are a major damage boost, as they allow you to hit the cap for multiple stats. The maximum sync value for weapons is 318 in each substat.

Use the most current food available. Any grade Tincture of Strength will grant the maximum benefit in UWU. 

If you wish to minmax further, a non-exhaustive list of best-in-slot configurations will be listed below. You can find a complete list in the dedicated best-in-slot guide for DRK.

## Offensive Cooldown Usage

Optimizing your damage on Dark Knight revolves heavily around shifting potency into raidbuffs, and ultimates are no different. For best results, coordinate with your group to know when burst windows are occurring. Generally speaking, you will want to pool resources for the start of each phase, with a second burst window near the middle. 

Note that it is impossible to provide a full map of each burst window because it depends heavily on comp, killtime, and how your party decides to align their cooldowns. The following phase optimization sections will provide guidelines for how to approach each one, but practicing and consulting with your group is the only way to know for sure.

## Defensive Cooldown Usage

Ultimate progression is a team effort. Because healers will likely be devoting significant resources to keep you alive, every bit of mitigation you can add will help greatly.

## Phase-by-phase optimization

### Garuda

Your opener should be similar to the level 80 opener with a few key adjustments. The main considerations are a very early Plunge, delayed Blood Weapon due to lack of Living Shadow, and delayed Abyssal Drain and Salted Earth to take advantage of plumes. An example MT opener is listed below: \

Plunge, Unmend, and facepull openers are all viable. The most important consideration is which one best allows both you and your fellow melee players to keep your GCDs rolling, as Garuda's small size and rapid movement can easily eat your inputs. Consider as well whether you gain a use of Plunge overall vs holding it for raidbuffs. The strength tincture, Rampart, and Salted Earth uses are timed so that they will be active while plumes are out and expire before Garuda jumps away.

The very early Plunge use allows a second use before Garuda jumps away after the first set of plumes. This then allows the third use to occur before she jumps away after Frictions, which in turn allows you to Plunge back onto the boss after blocking one of the double Mistral Songs.

Holding Delirium for plumes is not recommended. While this will naturally align with both sets of plumes, the extra AoE damage is typically not needed and comes at a cost of damage on the boss. You may even choose to cut out the Quietus from the example opener, as it may not be needed.

If you are not pulling Garuda, using Dark Mind to mitigate the Mistral Song will allow you to cover both hits from the Spiny Plume with Rampart+ Shadow Wall. Combined with Abyssal Drain's multi-target healing, this will considerably ease the healing burden. Your second use of Abyssal Drain can then be held until the second set of plumes, and the third to hit Ifrit and both front nails.

Plan your Reprisal uses with your cotank. Ideally, one tank should cover the Friction casts, and the other should hit the following Aerial Blast.

The second set of plumes come with quite a bit of damage on the main tank, so make sure to give them a shield with The Blackest Night (TBN) if you are not holding the boss.

You should ensure that you get a second use of Delirium during the phase. If your killtime is too fast to allow a full use at the end, move your first use earlier in your opener.

### Ifrit

It is possible to keep your combo rolling from Garuda's death to Ifrit's reappearance. However, this is a *very* tight window, so only try it if you're confident.

Discuss with your group whether you are making an effort to skip the dashes near the end of the phase or not. This means holding your tincture plus any major cooldowns Doing so means holding your potion 

If you are holding the boss during the nail phase, you can hit three targets with Flood of Darkness by targeting one nail and moving onto the hitbox of the other.

Nail phase is another period of heavy tank damage, so make sure the tank holding the boss gets a TBN. Use a defensive cooldown as well if you are holding Ifrit. Ideally, the tank with aggro during and after nail phase should avoid pulling Titan so that they can freely use their cooldowns during Ifrit. TBN is also valuable for Flaming Crush + autoattack damage.

### Titan

If Plunge is off cooldown when Titan first becomes targetable, you can use it immediately and have it available after the Upheaval knockback. Otherwise, hold it in the opener for that purpose.

Titan's Mountain Buster is one of the hardest-hitting tankbusters in the game, relative to max HP. Do not allow your cotank to take it without your TBN on them.

Fast killtimes can play havoc with your Delirium windows. You may be forced to push them into awkward times, such as at Upheaval or Magitek Bits, where you will lose hits to avoid losing an entire use. For very fast killtimes, losing that use will be unavoidable and you should aim to align your group's buffs into one burst window.

Don't be shy about dumping your mana before the phase ends. You will be able to generate nearly a full bar before Ultima is targetable.

### Intermission

Delirium can be used on the Magitek Bits and be available for Ultima opener. This doesn't do anything except make your parse better.

Blood Weapon can be used on Lahabrea. You should get five or six GCDs on Lahabrea, depending on how quickly your melee uses LB.

Remember to acquire a Dark Arts proc by using TBN on a non-tank before Ultima. 

Make sure that you are the one who uses tank LB, as it looks the coolest.

### Ultima

General buff timings are:

\- 60s cooldowns at opener, post-Predation, Annihilation, Aetheric Boom, and enrage

\- 90s cooldowns at opener, Annihilation, Aetheric Boom, and enrage

\- Tinctures at opener and enrage

Example reopener here:\
(picture of example opener)

Rampart and your tincture can be used before Ultima. Shadow Wall can also be used prepull, but the timing is rather tight.

Be careful about your usage of Reprisal on Tank Purges; it can inhibit LB generation and cause you to miss having LB3 post-Suppression.

Post-Predation is a good time to use defensive cooldowns, as Ultima will do a long string of attacks.

TBN by itself is sufficient for the Mistral Song damage during Suppression. Because you are guaranteed not to get the gaol, you can aid prog by banking blood and mana to dump into it.

Decide with your cotank who is using which tank LB at Aetheric Boom; if you are using the LB1, you will need to use Delirium immediately once Ultima is targetable.

Tank damage during primal roulette is very heavy, as Ultima will attack uninterrupted while multiple sources of damage pile on. You may opt to save Rampart at Aetheric Boom to use here. Either way, Dark Mind should be available for the second or third primal. Make sure the main tank gets a TBN as each primal's raidwide goes out.

The main tank cannot be targeted by an Eruption during primal roulette, so don't be shy about standing where you need to to allow for melee positionals.

Watch Ultima's HP; regardless of when your final burst is planned, you should use your tincture by the time the boss drops to around 15% HP to benefit from its full duration.



# The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCoB)

## Gearing

For level 70 ultimates, a full set of synced gear with critical hit + determination and enough pieces with critical hit + skill speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 418 or higher will max out both substats in UCoB. The last- and second-to-last steps of the Bozjan Resistance weapons will provide a significant damage boost, as they allow you to hit the cap on all four substats. The maximum sync value for weapons is 280 in each substat.

Use the most current food available. Any grade Tincture of Strength will grant the maximum benefit in UCoB.

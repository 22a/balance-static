# The Weapon's Refrain

## Best-in-slot

For level 70 ultimates, a full set of synced gear with critical hit + determination and enough pieces with critical hit + skill speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 470 or higher will max out both substats in UWU. The last- and second-to-last steps of the Bozjan Resistance weapons are a major damage boost, as they allow you to hit the cap for multiple stats. The maximum sync value for weapons is 318 in each substat.

If you wish to minmax further, a non-exhaustive list of best-in-slot configurations will be listed below. You can find a complete list in the dedicated best-in-slot guide for DRK.

## Offensive Cooldown Usage

Optimizing your damage on Dark Knight revolves heavily around shifting your potency skills into raidbuffs, and ultimates are no different. For best results, coordinate with your group to know when burst windows are occurring. Generally speaking, they will fall at the start of each phase, plus some time in the middle of each. For more detailed guidelines, see the sections below and consult with your group.

## Phase-by-phase optimization

### Garuda

Your opener should be similar to the level 80 opener with a few key adjustments. The main considerations are a very early Plunge, delayed Blood Weapon due to lack of Living Shadow, and delayed Abyssal Drain and Salted Earth to take advantage of plumes. An example opener is listed below: \

# The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)

## Best-in-slot

For level 70 ultimates, a full set of synced gear with critical hit + determination and enough pieces with critical hit + skill speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 470 or higher will max out both substats in UWU. The last- and second-to-last steps of the Bozjan Resistance weapons are a major damage boost, as they allow you to hit the cap for multiple stats. The maximum sync value for weapons is 318 in each substat.

Use the most current food available. Any grade Tincture of Strength will grant the maximum benefit in UWU. 

If you wish to minmax further, a non-exhaustive list of best-in-slot configurations will be listed below. You can find a complete list in the dedicated best-in-slot guide for DRK.

## Offensive Cooldown Usage

Optimizing your damage on Dark Knight revolves heavily around shifting potency into raidbuffs, and ultimates are no different. For best results, coordinate with your group to know when burst windows are occurring. Generally speaking, you will want to pool resources for the start of each phase, with a second burst window near the middle. 

Note that it is impossible to provide a full map of each burst window because it depends heavily on comp, killtime, and how your party decides to align their cooldowns. The following phase optimization sections will provide guidelines for how to approach each one, but practicing and consulting with your group is the only way to know for sure.

## Defensive Cooldown Usage

Ultimate progression is a team effort. Because healers will likely be devoting significant resources to keep you alive, every bit of mitigation you can add will help greatly.

## Phase-by-phase optimization

### Phase 1: Garuda

Your opener should be similar to the level 80 opener with a few key adjustments. The main considerations are a very early Plunge, delayed Blood Weapon due to lack of Living Shadow, and delayed Abyssal Drain and Salted Earth to take advantage of plumes. An example MT opener is listed below: \

Plunge, Unmend, and facepull openers are all viable. The most important consideration is which one best allows both you and your fellow melee players to keep your GCDs rolling, as Garuda's small size and rapid movement can easily eat your inputs. Consider as well whether you gain a use of Plunge overall vs holding it for raidbuffs. The strength tincture, Rampart, and Salted Earth uses are timed so that they will be active while plumes are out and expire before Garuda jumps away.

The very early Plunge use allows a second use before Garuda jumps away after the first set of plumes. This then allows the third use to occur before she jumps away after Frictions, which in turn allows you to Plunge back onto the boss after blocking one of the double Mistral Songs.

Holding Delirium for plumes is not recommended. While this will naturally align with both sets of plumes, the extra AoE damage is typically not needed and comes at a cost of damage on the boss. You may even choose to cut out the Quietus from the example opener, as it may not be needed.

If you are not pulling Garuda, using Dark Mind to mitigate the Mistral Song will allow you to cover both hits from the Spiny Plume with Rampart+ Shadow Wall. Combined with Abyssal Drain's multi-target healing, this will considerably ease the healing burden. Your second use of Abyssal Drain can then be held until the second set of plumes, and the third to hit Ifrit and both front nails.

Plan your Reprisal uses with your cotank. Ideally, one tank should cover the Friction casts, and the other should hit the following Aerial Blast.

The second set of plumes come with quite a bit of damage on the main tank, so make sure to give them a shield with The Blackest Night (TBN) if you are not holding the boss.

You should ensure that you get a second use of Delirium during the phase. If your killtime is too fast to allow a full use at the end, move your first use earlier in your opener.

### Phase 2: Ifrit

It is possible to keep your combo rolling from Garuda's death to Ifrit's reappearance. However, this is a *very* tight window, so only try it if you're confident.

Discuss with your group whether you are making an effort to skip the dashes near the end of the phase or not. This means holding your tincture plus any major cooldowns Doing so means holding your potion 

If you are holding the boss during the nail phase, you can hit three targets with Flood of Darkness by targeting one nail and moving onto the hitbox of the other.

Nail phase is another period of heavy tank damage, so make sure the tank holding the boss gets a TBN. Use a defensive cooldown as well if you are holding Ifrit. Ideally, the tank with aggro during and after nail phase should avoid pulling Titan so that they can freely use their cooldowns during Ifrit. TBN is also valuable for Flaming Crush + autoattack damage.

### Phase 3: Titan

If Plunge is off cooldown when Titan first becomes targetable, you can use it immediately and have it available after the Upheaval knockback. Otherwise, hold it in the opener for that purpose.

Titan's Mountain Buster is one of the hardest-hitting tankbusters in the game, relative to max HP. Do not allow your cotank to take it without your TBN on them.

Fast killtimes can play havoc with your Delirium windows. You may be forced to push them into awkward times, such as at Upheaval or Magitek Bits, where you will lose hits to avoid losing an entire use. For very fast killtimes, losing that use will be unavoidable and you should aim to align your group's buffs into one burst window.

Don't be shy about dumping your mana before the phase ends. You will be able to generate nearly a full bar before Ultima is targetable.

### Intermission

Delirium can be used on the Magitek Bits and be available for Ultima opener. This doesn't do anything except make your parse better.

Blood Weapon can be used on Lahabrea. You should get five or six GCDs on Lahabrea, depending on how quickly your melee uses LB.

Remember to acquire a Dark Arts proc by using TBN on a non-tank before Ultima. 

Make sure that you are the one who uses tank LB, as it looks the coolest.

### Phase 4: Ultima

General buff timings are:

\- 60s cooldowns at opener, post-Predation, Annihilation, Aetheric Boom, and enrage

\- 90s cooldowns at opener, Annihilation, Aetheric Boom, and enrage

\- Tinctures at opener and enrage

Example reopener here:\
(picture of example opener)

Rampart and your tincture can be used before Ultima. Shadow Wall can also be used prepull, but the timing is rather tight.

Be careful about your usage of Reprisal on Tank Purges; it can inhibit LB generation and cause you to miss having LB3 post-Suppression.

Post-Predation is a good time to use defensive cooldowns, as Ultima will do a long string of attacks.

TBN by itself is sufficient for the Mistral Song damage during Suppression. Because you are guaranteed not to get the gaol, you can aid prog by banking blood and mana to dump into it.

Decide with your cotank who is using which tank LB at Aetheric Boom; if you are using the LB1, you will need to use Delirium immediately once Ultima is targetable.

Tank damage during primal roulette is very heavy, as Ultima will attack uninterrupted while multiple sources of damage pile on. You may opt to save Rampart at Aetheric Boom to use here. Either way, Dark Mind should be available for the second or third primal. Make sure the main tank gets a TBN as each primal's raidwide goes out.

The main tank cannot be targeted by an Eruption during primal roulette, so don't be shy about standing where you need to to allow for melee positionals.

Watch Ultima's HP; regardless of when your final burst is planned, you should use your tincture by the time the boss drops to around 15% HP to benefit from its full duration.

# The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCoB)

## Gearing

For level 70 ultimates, a full set of synced gear with critical hit + determination and enough pieces with critical hit + skill speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 418 or higher will max out both substats in UCoB. The last- and second-to-last steps of the Bozjan Resistance weapons will provide a significant damage boost, as they allow you to hit the cap on all four substats. The maximum sync value for weapons is 280 in each substat.

Use the most current food available. Any grade Tincture of Strength will grant the maximum benefit in UCoB. 

If you wish to minmax further, a non-exhaustive list of best-in-slot configurations will be listed below. You can find a complete list in the dedicated best-in-slot guide for DRK.

## Offensive Cooldown Usage

Optimizing your damage on Dark Knight revolves heavily around shifting potency into raidbuffs, and ultimates are no different. For best results, coordinate with your group to know when burst windows are occurring. Generally speaking, you will want to pool resources for the start of each phase, with a second burst window near the middle.

The following phase optimization sections will provide guidelines for how to approach each one, but practicing and consulting with your group is the only way to know for sure.

## Phase-by-Phase Optimization

### Phase 1: Twintania

Use your preferred level 80 opener, with a few minor adjustments. First is the obvious omission of Living Shadow. Second is an early use of a defensive cooldown to cover the first Death Sentence if you are pulling. Third is a killtime-dependent shifting of Delirium; with fast pushes, your fourth use of Delirium is likely to get cut off by Nael's divebombs. It is worth pushing Delirium early in your opener to avoid this.

TBN should be used liberally to help with autoattack and tankbuster damage. While it can be used to help survive a Death Sentence, TBN is especially effective in mitigating Flattens because a tank who survives Death Sentence, even at low health, will not need immediate attention.

The third tank swap will not have Shirk available, so be ready to toggle tank stance.

### Phase 2: Nael

TBN can again be used very effectively in this phase, especially for quotes involving stacks. Dark Mind can also be used to mitigate stacks somewhat.

### Phase 3: Bahamut

My cooldown rotation for Bahamut:

\- First uptime: LD first Flatten (TBN/DM to survive Flare)

\- Post-Quickmarch: Rampart at individual Megaflare explosions to cover through Flatten, TBN+Reprisal

\- Post-Blackfire: Dark Mind + Shadow Wall + TBN for triple flares

\- Post-Fellruin: Swap or Cover

\- Post-Heavensfall: Dark Mind + Shadow Wall + TBN

\- Post-Tenstrike: Rampart or swap

### Phase 4: Teraflare/Adds

Use tincture in the opener here and it will be back up at the end of Golden.

Make sure to put TBN on whichever tank is holding Twintania during quotes, especially if it includes a stack. Dark Mind can help mitigate here.

### Phase 5: Golden Bahamut

You can leave one of your defensive cooldowns out of the first set of Akh Morns and use it for autoattacks instead.

I prefer to invuln the second and third Akh Morns for better cooldown availability.

Try to coordinate your final burst with all raidbuffs/personal cooldowns plus tincture.

Keep your finger on the LB button.

Don't get discouraged if you get a bad parse.

## Phase-by-Phase Optimization

### Phase 1: Living Liquid

Example MT opener:

(picture of the opener)

Rampart should be used about 7 seconds pre-pull in order to be available for the Drainage tethers later on.

Note the position of Abyssal Drain and Living Shadow; Abyssal is held for two-target cleave plus additional healing, and Living Shadow is used after the 4th GCD in order to delay its Quietus to cleave both bosses.

You can opt to pull with Unmend instead. If you do so, replace the last two hits of the Souleater combo with a Stalwart Soul combo. You will also need to use prepull Blood Weapon, as weaving Edge->Blood Weapon after Unmend without clipping is not feasible. The use of a spell with fixed 2.50-second recast time makes this Blood Weapon window somewhat tighter, but it is still consistently doable.

Briefly taking aggro on both bosses to use invulns on a double Fluid Swing plus additonal autoattacks has very high value. With fast killtimes, using invulns in such a way may cause you to be unable to use them in Phase 3, but the tradeoff is almost always worth it.

Note that if you do use Living Dead for a set of Fluid Swings, you will probably need to use TBN on yourself directly afterward because Hand of Pain ignores invulnerability.

TBN has great value in this phase in general. Starting after the first double Fluid Swing, it can be chained on cooldown to cover, in order, autoattacks while moving back to center, the second double Fluid Swing, autoattacks plus Protean damage on the hand tank, and the Drainage tethers.

Shadow Wall can be used directly after the first Hand of Pain and last through the second Fluid Swing.

The fixed 2.50-second recast time on your AoE combo makes getting full value from Blood Weapon difficult. The best way to deal with this is to hold it until you reach 100 blood and then do the following rotation:

Unleash->Blood Weapon->Bloodspiller->Bloodspiller->Stalwart Soul->Bloodspiller->Unleash

This sequence only waits on the 2.50 recast time once while Blood Weapon is active and should be consistently doable. This should happen as the Drainage tethers go out if you got all five hits of your first Blood Weapon, or earlier if you didn't. You can also opt to hold Blood Weapon for your second Delirium if killtime permits.

### Phase 2: Bruise Chaser/Cruise Justice

Buffs should go out very early in the phase, so you can precast Living Shadow to take full advantage of them. Use after Cruise Chaser disappears to catch buffs after the first GCD, or as Brute Justice's textbox appears for buffs after the second GCD.

TBN should again be used liberally in this phase. Long strings of autoattacks, lightning passes, and raidwides plus autoattacks will all quickly break your shield and potentially save resources from your healers.

Rampart can be used after the Spin Crusher cast finishes to cover a string of autoattacks, mines, ice, and a lightning pass. This is also a good spot to TBN.

Missionary is surprisingly hard to hit all players with. The best spots are at Missile Command to cover mines + second water pass, or shortly after Plasma Shield to cover Whirlwind + third water pass.

### Phase 3: Alexander Prime

Tinctures must be used in the post-Temporal Stasis uptime window to be available for the start of the final phase. Major cooldowns won't be available until the end of Inception Formation if not held at the end of Phase 2, however, so discuss with your group how you want to handle buff alignment. Generally speaking, Phase 3 does have a somewhat tighter DPS check and more room for deaths that will cripple a player's damage output without wiping the party outright.

Delirium windows in post-Temporal Stasis and post-Inception Formation uptime phases will be identical; if you get cut off after three hits in the first section, you will get cut off after three hits again in the second, with a slim chance for a fourth.

Living Shadow should be precast after Inception Formation to fit more hits under buffs. Casting it as Brute Justice lands should put its first hit under buffs cast after the second GCD.

Reprisal can be used once the castbar passes the "E" in "Mega Holy" after Wormhole Formation to cover both hits.

Salted Earth will tick on both bosses at triple enrage if placed like so:

(picture of salted earth)

AoE combos will also hit both bosses if used in this spot. You can additionally hit both bosses with Flood of Shadow by targeting one and moving into the hitbox of the other. Make sure to summon Living Shadow closer to Brute Justice than Cruise Chaser so it won't jump onto the invulnerable Alexander Prime after Cruise Chaser is killed. Delirium can be held until 120s buffs go out.

You will gain about 4800 mana during the cutscene after Phase 3, so take that into account.

Remember to use the tank LB3 because DRK's is the coolest.

### Phase 4: Perfect Alexander

Plan your opener around having 8 GCDs before stopping for Ordained Stillness if it comes first. Blood Weapon does not need to be used immediately if you have enough blood banked to summon Living Shadow because Fate Calibration Beta will prevent you from gaining or losing a use regardless. Untarget the boss for Ordained Stillness to prevent autoattacks from triggering it rather than performing the additional action of sheathing your weapon. You can sneak in an extra GCD after Stillness if it comes first, or after The Final Word if Ordained Motion is first.

If your group has strong 120s buffs, it may be worth it to hold your second Delirium in the phase to align with the second use of them.

60-second cooldowns must be used ASAP after Fate Calibration Beta and used again as they come up to avoid losing a use to Temporal Prison.

Discuss with your cotank and healers how you want to handle the tankbusters in this phase. Two of them should be handled with invulns, and one of them with conventional cooldowns. Regardless of which buster you use Living Dead for, you can use Dark Mind + TBN to survive the first hit and give your healers a slightly longer window to cleanse Walking Dead.

Perfect Alexander does not autoattack very much except during Irresistible Grace ("Exatrines"). Ask for a Feint, use a defensive cooldown if available, and give whoever is tanking a TBN because the risk of tank death is high here.

Plan who will take which Temporal Prison during the enrage sequence. Tanks usually take the third and fourth prisons; if you handle your cooldowns well, you should take the fourth prison if you cotank is a Paladin or Warrior, or the third prison if your cotank is a Gunbreaker.

# A Note Regarding Ultimates:

Ultimate's mitigation plans will vary significantly depending on how fast your group pushes each phase. In general, take note of where heavy raidwides and tankbusters are and plan to have group/personal mitigation ready for them. Squeeze out any extra uses of your cooldowns that you can for auto attacks. Ultimate autos hurt a lot so it is a good idea to try to cover them with mit as much as possible.

Openers/rotations will also vary depending on your push timings. In general, aim to get things under raid buffs, but be prepared to tailor your opener to fit your group's push timings.

# Level 70 Ultimates

## The Unending Coils of Bahamut/UCoB


If your push timings are fast, consider prepull No Mercy into Sonic Break to open. You gain a partial No Mercy before Bahamut if you use it on cooldown instead of holding it at the end of Twintania, and keep it on cooldown during Nael. It may be worth holding the final NM for Nael if your group is skipping Nael divebombs. 

You can get 2 Danger Zones between Blackfire and Fellruin, and 2 full GF combos between Fellruin and Heavensfall in Bahamut. You cannot get 2 Danger Zones between Fellruin and Heavensfall if you got 2 between Blackfire and Fellruin due to when it will come back off cooldown.

## The Weapon's Refrain/UWU

Opener Bow Shock is delayed to hit all of the plumes as they come in. Your rotation will change significantly depending on push timings. Be prepared to adjust as you go. 

Ultima Reopener should hold a cartridge to end on a Burst Strike before Predation, otherwise the Solid Barrel that you would do there instead will ghost. Hold the next GF after Predation for No Mercy. Boss phasing makes it so it is not a gain to do that GF instantly after Predation. See below

# Level 80 Ultimates

## The Epic of Alexander (TEA)
 
At 2.40, the Demon Slice will only hit Living Liquid, as Liquid Hand has not spawned yet, but it prepares the rotation for the following Demon Slaughter to hit both targets.


It is suggested to use Heart of Stone and Reprisal after Sonic Break. Heart of Stone will cover the tankbuster swipe, and reprisal will cover both the swipe and the following cascade.


Minimal movement required to bait palm in LL phase: <https://bit.ly/2Rkd4Vh>


For LL and BJCC, you should be using Demon Slaughter combo and Fated Circle instead of Solid Barrel combo and Burst Strike any time you can hit both bosses. Use NM, GF, and Sonic Break normally, try to get Bow Shock to hit both targets when possible while staying inside NM. 


For Alex Prime phase, always do Sonic Break first to get maximum ticks. The exception is between Inception and Wormhole. You can get a second BZ before Wormhole if you do pre NM, BZ, Sonic Break instead of pre NM, Sonic Break, BZ. This is a gain even if it causes you to get 8/9 GCDs under NM for that section. 


J Waves 2 target AoE spot: <https://bit.ly/3ySRM2g>


For Perfect Alexander, if you are seeing jails, you should not use NM more than a few GCDs after he spawns or risk losing NM GCDs to final word, and you must use NM exactly on CD after Fate Calibration Beta or you will lose a partial NM before being jailed.  GNB should take 4th jail and you should be able to get Sonic Break, Bow Shock, Blasting Zone, and at least most of the Gnashing Fang Combo before being jailed.

# FAQ

> **Help! I don't have X piece for UCoB BiS?!**

That's okay! Substats on gear cap at iLvl 418 in UCoB. Simply use any piece of gear iLvl 418 or higher that has the same substats. They'll be the same when synced!

> **Help! I don't have X piece for UWU BiS?!**

That's okay! Substats on gear cap at iLvl 470 in UWU. Simply use any piece of gear iLvl 470 or higher that has the same substats. They'll be the same when synced!


> **Why doesn't X piece have materia?**

Any piece of gear that gets item level synced has its materia nullified, effectively meaning those pieces materia slots are useless.
<br>Any piece that is i345 and under in UCoB, i375 and under in UWU, or i475 and under in TEA, will gain full value from their respective materia!

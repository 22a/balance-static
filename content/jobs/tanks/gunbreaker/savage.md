## E9S:
Paladins can cover the first hit of the normally tank-swapped buster, then max melee behind the boss to break the tether on you, in order to avoid tank swapping. This is preferred by many groups. 

You can use Superbolide for Anti-Air to keep uptime without getting a damage down. If both tanks use their invuln, they can stack together for it. 


## E10S:
Doggo Wall Dodge:

Note: this can be done without clipping at all, but this is difficult to do due to the snapshot timing of the orbs.

## E11S:
-3.5s pot into NM Sonic Break to start the fight is good here. 

If you have early buffs, you can do 1st gcd NM, 3rd gcd Sonic, and reverse drift Sonic to the front of NM for full ticks during the 2:00 NM. 

Raid buff opener is not worth it here as you lose more potency from lost ticks than you gain from playing into those buffs. 

Consider delaying your 4min NM to 4:30 for raid buff+pot alignment  (does not cost you a use and this is where groups will optimally hold their raid buffs for).

~07:40 During Bound of Faith you can take Burn Mark(Powder Marks' explosion) and the danger mirror side with Superbolide or Hallowed so you   
A) don't have to disengage at all and   
B) invuln the buster damage  

Does not work with War/Drk invuln as you receive a damage down

If you are not using bolide here, you can sprint and run through the boss after the Burn Mark explodes. See <https://clips.twitch.tv/OutstandingAbrasiveFloofFeelsBadMan>

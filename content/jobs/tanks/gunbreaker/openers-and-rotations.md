# Gunbreaker Openers and Rotations

# Openers

Openers are designed to do a few very important things:
1. Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost uses.
2. Get strong abilities under raid buffs. This helps to maximize damage done. More damage is always better, especially when it's free!
3. Set up our rotation for the rest of the fight (or until a transition/extended period of downtime). This is especially important for fight specific optimizations and using the right opener may gain a use of important abilities like the Gnashing Fang combo.

The theoretical standard opener for a full-uptime encounter is the 4th GCD No Mercy opener (below). At higher levels of gameplay, you can and should adjust your opener based on your group composition and the specifics of the fight.

# Rotations and Priorities

## Priority System

Previous GNB guides have thought of the rotation in terms of a 60s/three minute loop. In practice, the GNB rotation is much less a loop and more of a priority system. GNB is more accurately an “if X is ready, do X, else do Y” class. Therefore, after the opener the rotation priority is as follows (with one caveat, mentioned following the priority list):

1. Use **No Mercy** on cooldown.
2. Use **Gnashing Fang**, **Sonic Break**, **Blasting Zone**, **Bow Shock**, **Bloodfest** on cooldown. 
3. Spend all Cartridges inside **No Mercy** where possible. 
4. Use **Rough Divide** twice inside **No Mercy** (unless a use is needed for uptime)
5. Outside of **No Mercy**, only spend Cartridges on **Gnashing Fang** or if you would otherwise overcap on Cartridges.
6. Use **Solid Barrel** combo on 1 target, **Demon Slaughter** combo on 2+ targets if nothing higher on the priority is available. 

* Since **Gnashing Fang** and **Sonic Break** have their cooldown reduced by skill speed, we need to delay them by one GCD every minute by adding a filler GCD. Otherwise they will end up being before No Mercy which is a significant loss. 

Because GNB is more of a priority system than a strict rotation, the rotation is very flexible and can be adjusted to the needs of the encounter and group composition.

## GCD Uptime

GCD uptime refers to pressing your weapon skills (GCDs) as soon as they are available. If there are spaces between when your GCD is ready and when you press the next one, you will lose a significant amount of damage. As such, we aim to keep our GCDs rolling as much as possible. Please note, this only refers to when an enemy is present. It is possible to achieve a minimum of 96% uptime in every fight. Anything lower than that is almost guaranteed to be caused by not playing correctly. How to increase this number around mechanics that normally seem like they should cause downtime is a fight specific optimization and will vary fight to fight. Even if you are making mistakes, it is almost always better to keep your GCD rolling than to just not do anything. 

A big part of GCD uptime for GNB comes from being able to move bosses during heavy burst windows. Since the **Gnashing Fang** combo must be followed by **Continuation**, which is a melee range skill, it can make moving the boss during this window frustrating. Some common ways to alleviate this frustration are:

1. Sprint! The faster you move, the faster the boss moves to you. Just be careful not to go too fast so you don’t rip the boss out of the range of melee dps. 
2. Take advantage of the ability to use **Burst Strike** between **Gnashing** combo GCDs. This will give you an extra GCD with no required weaves to move faster. 
3. Press the GCD, move out, then move back in before the next GCD is ready so you have enough time to use **Continuation** without delaying the next GCD. There are two ways to do this. For example, you could:

**Gnashing Fang**, run out, run back in, **Jugular Rip**, **Savage Claw**, run out, run back in, **Abdomen Tear**, **Wicked Talon**, run out, run back in, **Eye Gouge**, etc. 
Or
**Gnashing Fang**, **Jugular Rip**, run out, run back in, **Savage Claw**, **Abdomen Tear**, run out, run back in, **Wicked Talon**, **Eye Gouge**, run out, run back in, etc.

How you approach this will largely be personal preference as well as fight specific optimization. Do what gets the best results for you. You should also ask your co-tank if they can handle moving the boss if it makes it easier on you, and doesn’t make it harder on everyone else!

# Rotation FAQ

> *Do I save Bloodfest for No Mercy?*

Use bloodfest on cooldown. It should naturally align with No Mercy every 3 minutes for a 4x Burst Strike in No Mercy opportunity 


> *Do I hold No Mercy/Gnashing Fang combo for one another?*

Generally speaking if you mess up, using them on cooldown is more damage. However when you have strong raid cooldowns such as Trick attack, then you want to keep yourself aligned with them. This is especially true if you messed up early in the fight. You also want to hit buttons where you were supposed to rather than adjust on the fly for practice purposes. Basically there's no correct answer to this and you should look for ways to avoid messing up in the first place instead 


> *When do I AoE?*

2+ targets for general AoE. At 3 targets and under you still want to use Gnashing Fang combo and Sonic Break on cooldown.


> *Help! I'm clipping my GCDs!*

If you're not losing a GCD in No Mercy, then it's acceptable to clip during that window. Outside of No Mercy, find ways to pre-emptively hit defensive cooldowns in order to not clip. Clipping Blasting Zone to prevent drift is acceptable.

> *What GCD should I have?*

The Gunbreaker Rotation works off a 2.4 GCD. This is the minimum that you need. Any more will not affect your dps output strongly. Any less and you lose a lot of dps due to abilities not lining up with No Mercy.


> *My ping is x and my GCD is y!! Can I do etc.?! Should I go faster to compensate?!*


Realistically you can succeed with any of the Skill speed tiers regardless of ping unless you're playing from a different continent. Skill speed is more related to fight design tbh. 2.4 GCD will give you the best results if you're a perfect human being, 2.38 will let you get away with being monkey every now then.


> *About SSS or La-*

SSS or Lawns are in no way any indication of your ability to succeed or your actual dps output.

> *What if I misaligned my Gnashing Fang from No Mercy because of Downtime/user error?*

Don't worry! This happens. It's going to happen to all of us. Follow this flow:
- Less than 17s on No Mercy? Hold Gnashing Fang or it will be pushed out of No Mercy.
-  More than 17s on No Mercy? Don't hold Gnashing Fang because it will come up during the latter half of No Mercy.

# FAQ

> *Why do the GNB Ultimate BiS Sets use the i515 Resistance Weapon intead of the i535??*

The i535 weapon only gives +15 more substats over the 515. This is not enough to hit another tier in any stat for any of the ultimates. Because of this, there is functionally no difference between them and you are free to use whichever you want/have available.

> *The non-relic weapon TEA bis has the TEA weapon, what do I do if I don't have the TEA weapon yet?*

The Edengrace Manatrigger is equivalent to the TEA weapon, minus one meld slot. Use the 475 Edengrace Manatrigger if you do not have the TEA weapon.

# Meld Priority
Gunbreaker meld priority is fairly simple:

- Item Level 
  - (higher item level means higher stats, and is usually an upgrade regardless of stat types. RARE EXCEPTIONS EXIST!)

- Critical Hit 
  - (meld to each item's substat cap, unless it's red or naturally capped. Exceptions of +59 instead of +60 exist) 

- Skill Speed 
  - (Gunbreaker is very versatile and can be played at a lot of GCD tiers. Choose one that's right for you and meld appropriately)

- Direct Hit 
  - (meld remaining slots) 

- Determination 
  - (sometimes melded in 1 slot instead of direct hit due to stat tiering)

- Tenacity 
  - (not recommended if incoming damage and healing are predictable)

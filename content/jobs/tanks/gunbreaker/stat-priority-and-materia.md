# Meld Priority

Gunbreaker meld priority is fairly simple:

- Item Level 
  - (Higher item level means higher stats, and is usually an upgrade regardless of stat types. *RARE EXCEPTIONS EXIST!*)

- Critical Hit 
  - (Meld to each item's substat cap, unless it's red or naturally capped. Exceptions of +59 instead of +60 exist) 

- Skill Speed 
  - (Gunbreaker is very versatile and can be played at a lot of GCD tiers. Choose one that's right for you and meld appropriately)

- Direct Hit 
  - (Meld remaining slots) 

- Determination 
  - (Sometimes melded in 1 slot instead of direct hit due to stat tiering)

- Tenacity 
  - (Not recommended if incoming damage and healing are predictable)

# FAQ

> **Help! I don't have X piece for UCoB BiS?!**

That's okay! Substats on gear cap at iLvl 418 in UCoB. Simply use any piece of gear iLvl 418 or higher that has the same substats. They'll be the same when synced!

> **Help! I don't have X piece for UWU BiS?!**

That's okay! Substats on gear cap at iLvl 470 in UWU. Simply use any piece of gear iLvl 470 or higher that has the same substats. They'll be the same when synced!


> **Why doesn't X piece have materia?**

Any piece of gear that gets item level synced has its materia nullified, effectively meaning those pieces materia slots are useless.
<br>Any piece that is i345 and under in UCoB, i375 and under in UWU, or i475 and under in TEA, will gain full value from their respective materia!

# Meld Priority

Gunbreaker meld priority is fairly simple:

- Item Level 
  - Higher item level means higher stats, and is usually an upgrade regardless of stat types.
  - *RARE EXCEPTIONS EXIST!*

- Critical Hit 
  - Meld to each item's substat cap, unless it's red or naturally capped. Exceptions of +59 instead of +60 exist

- Skill Speed 
  - Gunbreaker is very versatile and can be played at a lot of GCD tiers. Choose one that's right for you and meld appropriately

- Direct Hit 
  - Meld remaining slots

- Determination 
  - Sometimes melded in 1 slot instead of direct hit due to stat tiering

- Tenacity 
  - Not recommended if incoming damage and healing are predictable

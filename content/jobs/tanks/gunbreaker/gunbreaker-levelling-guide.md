# AoE or Single Target + Leveling


The basics of GNB gameplay will change depending on what Character Level you are currently playing as. Even though GNB starts at level 60, sometimes you may be Level Synced to below 60. 


**No Mercy** is unlocked at Level 2, so you will have it available for any content. While in combat, you should always use No Mercy on cooldown. This is *not* a list of openers, but a general priority of what you should be using at each level. Even though they will not be listed, remember to use your oGCDs on cooldown or as close to on cooldown as possible while in combat. 


# Level 15-29 
*(Solid Barrel Unlocked at 26)*

1-2 Targets:   
Keen Edge -> Brutal Shell (-> Solid Barrel) 

3+ Targets:   
Demon Slice spam


# Level 30-39
1 Target:  
Keen Edge -> Brutal Shell -> Solid Barrel -> Burst Strike

2 Targets:  
Demon Slice spam


It is optimal to spend all Burst Strikes under No Mercy unless you would overcap. (i.e. if you have 2 Cartridges, use a Burst Strike before finishing the next Solid Barrel combo so you don't waste a Cartridge by overcapping.) **This applies at all levels.**


# Level 40-59 
*(Sonic Break Unlocked at 54)*

1 Target:  
(Sonic Break ->) Keen Edge -> Brutal Shell -> Solid Barrel -> Burst Strike

2 Targets:  
(Sonic Break ->) Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter -> Burst Strike

3+ Targets:  
(Sonic Break ->) Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter  
(Ignore cartridges)


For now, it will often be optimal to ignore cartridges in AoE until Fated Circle is unlocked at 72.  
Sonic Break should always be used under No Mercy. 


# Level 60-71

1 Target:  
Sonic Break -> Keen Edge -> Brutal Shell -> Solid Barrel -> Burst Strike;
Gnashing Fang -> Savage Claw -> Wicked Talon every 30 seconds. 


2 Targets:  
Sonic Break -> Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter -> Burst Strike; 
Gnashing Fang -> Savage Claw -> Wicked Talon every 30 seconds. 


3 Targets:  
Sonic Break -> Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter; 
Gnashing Fang -> Savage Claw -> Wicked Talon every 30 seconds.
(Ignore Cartridges except for Gnashing Fang)


4+ Targets:   
Sonic Break -> Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter 
(Ignore Cartridges and Gnashing Fang)


From Level 60 onward, you should always save a Cartridge for Gnashing Fang instead of using it for Burst Strike/Fated Circle when Gnashing Fang has 10s or less on its cooldown.


From Level 70 onward, Gnashing Fang, Savage Claw, and Wicked Talon should always be followed by their respective Continuation actions (Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, and Eye Gouge respectively).


# Level 72+

1 Target:  
Sonic Break -> Keen Edge -> Brutal Shell -> Solid Barrel -> Burst Strike; 
Gnashing Fang -> Savage Claw -> Wicked Talon every 30s


2-3 Targets: 
Sonic Break -> Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter -> Fated Circle;
Gnashing Fang -> Savage Claw -> Wicked Talon every 30s


4+ Targets:  
Sonic Break -> Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter -> Fated Circle  
(Ignore Gnashing Fang)


# Essentially at Level 80:


For 1 target present, we use Solid Barrel combo and Burst Strike.  
For 2+ targets: Demon Slaughter combo and Fated Circle.


Continue to use the Gnashing Fang combo on cooldown until there are 4+ targets. At 4+ you should ignore the Gnashing Fang combo and only use the Demon Slaughter combo and Fated Circle. 


Use No Mercy on cooldown regardless of how many targets you have. Whether or not Sonic Break is useful in multi-target fights will depend on how long it will be on the target as well as the number of targets. Whether or not to use it will be a case-by-case basis. At somewhere around 5+ targets, it likely will be a loss to use regardless.

Special note: DNC fight specific tips can be difficult to identify due to some things being party composition dependent and kill time dependent. In general, if you are learning a fight or going for a clear, it will most often be best to keep your cooldowns (Dances / Devilment / Flourish) off cooldown as much as possible and try not to delay. The tips found in this document are fight specific tips that help identify how to interact with certain mechanics, especially as they coincide with your cooldowns.

\[E5S - Ramuh]\
\[E6S - Ifrit and Garuda]\
\[E7S - The Idol of Darkness]\
\[E8S - Shiva]  

# E5S - Ramuh

* Doing the second use of Technical Step when it comes back up from opener (at 2:02 min) will have you doing the steps as the knock back occurs, which slightly delays Technical Finish to align with Devilment so you can do   

  * TF → DM → Proc/SD → Flourish → etc...
* For the third usage of Technical Step you have two options: hold until after knockback or use on cooldown and the knockback will happen while the Technical Finish / Devilment buffs are still active.\
  For this circumstance, we consider the following points:  

  * Holding the Technical Step will result in a loss of a Technical Step / Devilment usage if your kill time is roughly between 8:20 and 8:35 or between 10:20 and 10:35  
  * Doing the 3rd technical step on cooldown (Technical finish going out at approximately 4:08-4:10) results in some loss due to party members missing approximately 2 GCDs on the boss while the Technical Finish / Devilment buffs are out.
  * If you delay Flourish for this Technical Step as well, you will lose a Flourish cast if your kill time is between approximately X:25 and X:45 assuming you use Flourish on cooldown for the rest of the fight.
  * If you have a Ninja, they lose a usage of Trick Attack and Kassatsu if they hold for after the knockback if the kill time is between X:20 and X:35
  * If you do your Technical Step off cooldown, you can delay your Standard Step by 1-2 GCDs so the steps lines up with Fury’s Fourteen knockback and the portion when Ramuh is untargetable, which reclaims potential lost GCD(s) during that knockback period.
  * **Conclusion:** If you do not know your kill time or are pugging the fight, it’s best to use Technical Step / Devilment / Flourish on cooldown and don’t delay for the Fury’s Fourteen knockback otherwise you may lose a cast. 
  * If you are trying to optimize this fight in a group setting, coordinate with other party members when to use raid buffs. Delaying these buffs together for after the knockback will most likely be a gain for your group provided you don’t lose a cast.
* Second potion works best for the fourth Technical Step (which should be either around 6:10 or 6:30 depending on whether you kept third Technical off cooldown or if you held it).
* DNCs are ranged and very mobile. Consider when grabbing an orb for mechanics to grab the ones that are farther away from the boss / farther away from party members to allow less mobile jobs to grab their orb closer to the boss. The tank kiting the bird add will appreciate this too.

# E6S - Ifrit and Garuda

* You can use Improvisation after your last GCD on Garuda before Technical Step becomes available for 1-2 ticks of Improvisation. If you are in group setting where you can coordinate it, consider finding a way to have your group stack somewhere for the end of Garuda  → beginning of Ifrit transition. Still start your Technical Step as soon as it comes off cooldown for the beginning of Ifrit.  

  * If running a 2.50s set, getting the last GCD off on Garuda at ~1:59 is nigh impossible. Even if able to use the GCD, the damage will generally ghost--there is a delay between using the ability and having the damage register of approximately 0.7-0.9 seconds.\
    Consider starting Improvisation at 1:56 after the GCD goes out (Tech should have about 6 seconds left) for extra ticks assuming the group is stacked. 
* Because DNCs are ranged and very mobile, they should be taking a tether during both Hands of Hell mechanics during this first Ifrit phase.
* If keeping Flourish and Technical Step off cooldown from opener through Ifrit + Garuda transition, you can hit both Garuda and Ifrit with Technical Finish → Flourish → Blood Shower (both targets) before the debuffs go out (at 4:09). Then continue your normal Technical Finish window on your target.
* Use Improvisation after the Ifrit + Garuda phase (at approximately 5:05) during the long downtime. You should be able to get 5 full ticks. Make sure to use any Esprit you have before the end of the Ifrit + Garuda phase to ensure you get the most out of these ticks.
* Flourish comes off cooldown during the downtime before Raktapaksa. If you use it around 5:20 (after finishing Improvisation), you should have enough time to do Standard Step (assuming you have kept it off cooldown the whole fight) and get all 4 procs off on Raktapaksa when they appear before the procs expire. The text prompt for this is when the speech bubble says, “Gwooooooh”!

  * If this delay in Flourish causes a lost cast of Flourish (if your kill time is between X:20 and X:35), consider doing the Flourish cast during transition (around 5:10) → Improvisation → Standard Step (when it becomes available) and use as many procs as you can (prioritize the Fountain Fall and Blood Shower so that if you have to drop a proc, it’s either Reverse Cascade or Rising Windmill). This is only a gain if you gain a Flourish cast before the end of the fight that you otherwise would not have had. If you would not have lost this Flourish cast, doing Flourish off cooldown during transition is an overall loss due to losing one or two procs.
  * If you have a Ninja, since Trick Attack cannot be kept off cooldown during the transition, doing your Flourish off cooldown during the transition will desync Flourish from Trick Attack for the rest of the fight.
  * **Conclusion:** Since the enrage is approximately 10:15, delaying this Flourish during the Raktapaksa transition will not lose you a Flourish cast if you reach enrage. In most cases, it’s best to use the Flourish towards the end of the intermission so you can land all of your procs when Raktapaksa is targetable.
* The fourth use of Technical Step comes off cooldown around 6:02 if using it off cooldown. If you have a Ninja, consider delaying this Technical Finish + Devilment along with other raid buffs to 6:30 (during the Ferrostorm after the stack pairs) when they can next use Trick Attack due to the delay of the first Trick Attack on Raktapaksa opener (it will also sync Technical Step back up with Flourish if you delay it while waiting for the transition). This is also the perfect time to use your second potion.

  * Special Note: This delay will lose you a cast of Technical Step / Devilment if your kill time is approximately between 8:25-8:40.

# E7S - The Idol of Darkness

* The second use of Technical Step / Devilment coincides with the Betwixt Worlds + Teleport mechanic. 

  * If your party is handling the mechanic with having all the teleports resolve in different lanes (such as “Cross T” strategy), don’t start Technical Finish until after your teleport resolves. This will give the other players enough time to return back to the middle before you finish your dance steps. Starting the Technical Step before the teleport could result in the Technical Finish happening before some players have returned to the middle which can lead to them missing the damage buff.
  * If your party is handling the mechanic in a way that all party members resolve the teleport and mechanics in the middle lane (such as “diamond” strategy), you can start the Technical Step before the teleport stun locks you since everyone will not have to run as far to return back to the middle to receive your Technical Finish buff.
* Optimal uses of Dances during add phase include trying to hit all three adds with each of your Dances. Depending on how the Idolatry adds are tanked, you may or may not be able to reach all three adds from the middle. If there are too far apart, you can at the very least hit two adds with your Dances.
* For start of adds, prep a Standard Step during the transition (assuming you kept Standard Step off cooldown since the beginning of the fight) and pop Flourish right after your Standard Finish when the adds appear.
* Using Technical Finish / Devilment during add phase is worthwhile because of the length of the phase leaning towards losing a cast if you otherwise don’t use them. Try your best to hit as many party members with the Technical Finish buff and as many of the adds with the Technical Finish damage. This Technical Step lines up with the Strength in Numbers (donut AoE) but even if you had to delay the Technical during the Betwixt Worlds mechanic, you should still have enough time to do the Technical Finish toward the middle of the arena and go to the safe spot in the donut AoE afterwards.
* You can use Improvisation during the downtime after add phase. Depending on your adds kill time, your Standard Step may come off cooldown during this time, if so, prioritize prepping Standard Step over Improvisation.
* How fast your party kills the add phase will determine which mechanics some of your abilities (especially Technical Step and Devilment) will come off cooldown during. If you are in an organized group, consider talking to your group about coordinating raid buffs. Everyone keeping them off cooldown as much as possible will help them stay mostly in sync.
* Second potion works well for fourth usage of Technical Step and Devilment (roughly around 6:20)
* While waiting for tornado and its associated knockback, you can pick a corner ideally with the rest of your group and start using Improvisation. Position yourself close enough to the middle so that when the knockback occurs, you’re already in good position to be knocked back into a safe corner.
* If your group killed adds on the slower side, but you managed to keep your Technical Step off cooldown as much as possible, you’ll likely be able to get the fifth cast of Technical Step at the start of the tornado phase before everyone separates to their color corners.
* If your group killed adds on the faster side, Technical Step won’t be off cooldown until everyone is separated during the first round of the tornado phase. Your Technical Finish here will likely miss a lot of party members, so it’s best to delay this about 15-20 seconds until the party reunites for the Threefold Grace / Empty Wave mechanics. It is possible to hit all seven party members during the tornado phase, but this requires every party member to get in as tight as possible inside the boss’s hitbox in their respective sections during the Technical Finish cast. This is only recommended for groups going for highly optimized strategies.
* If your kill time is long, you can do a sixth Technical Step / Devilment which can be delayed to sync up with third potion (you might not need to delay this Technical Step / Devilment any more than you did while delaying it during first tornado cycle).

# E8S - Shiva

* Use Improvisation during the transition from Phase One to add phase while standing as close to the middle of the arena while staying on your side to hit all seven party members.
  Using Flourish off cooldown after your opener on Shiva will earn you a fourth Flourish right at the end of Phase One that you can get approximately 3-4 GCDs after popping.
* If you do Standard Step off cooldown, you are technically able to get off a Standard Step right before Shiva jumps at the end of phase 1. However, this Standard Step is arguably not worth it because you won’t be able to take advantage of that fourth Flourish right before the jump and you will be limited on using as many of your resources (Esprit and f-Feathers) if you are dancing during the last 5 seconds of the phase.
* If not attempting the aforementioned Standard Step in Phase One, you can choose to delay Standard Step by one to two GCDs total during Diamond Frost to ensure you hit Shiva after being knocked back by Heavenly Strike (depending on how your party handles Diamond Frost). This delay will also mean Standard Step will line up during the lookaway mechanic for your next Standard Step which makes it easier since you do not have to be facing your target while doing a dance.
* All of the phases and mechanics are on a static timer for this fight. The damage you do during add phase will not make the phase end any quicker and will not help you with the overall DPS check of Shiva besides successfully clearing add phase with no Flood of Light generated to gain the ~2% damage up buff for the first minute of phase 3. 
* Therefore, optimal play during add phase would be to use as much of your Esprit and Feathers before add phase on Shiva and then try to conserve as much of this esprit and feathers so you can use them on your reopener on Shiva. 
* You **SHOULD** use Flourish during add phase because it’s on a short cooldown and will be back up after the long cutscene for the reopener. It can also help you generate 4 Feathers that you can save for your reopener on Shiva.
* You **SHOULD NOT** use Technical Step / Devilment during add phase because this will significantly desync these abilities from raid buffs in the reopener.
* As best you can, try to conserve Esprit and Feathers during add phase so you can use them on the reopener. If an add would otherwise have survived, you can use some of these resources just to ensure successful completion of the add phase. Ideal situation is to end add phase with successfully getting the ~2% damage buff AND with 100 Esprit and 4 Feathers for your reopener on Shiva.
* Dancer Partner during Shiva adds phase → ideally you will want to be on the same side as your normal dance partner for add phase, but if you are on separate sides, you should switch to the DPS member on your side for add phase, and then remove the closed position buff from them before you get stunned going into the long cutscene. Then, before you start your reopener, put Closed Position back on your main partner (this will delay your reopener by approximately 0.8 seconds due to this clip but is worth it to ensure maximum gains with being partnered with the best possible partner).

**Reopener on Shiva (Phase 3):**

*With at least 50 Esprit coming back from adds:*\
Technical Step → 4 Steps → (hard clip potion) → Technical Finish (Devilment) → Saber Dance → Standard Step → 2 Steps → Standard Finish (Flourish) → continue with normal  

**Technical Finish GCD priority**

*If you do not have enough Esprit for that first GCD Saber Dance:*\
Technical Step → 4 Steps → (hard clip potion) → Technical Finish (Devilment) → Standard Step → 2 Steps → Standard Finish (Flourish) → continue with normal Technical Finish GCD priority

* In either case, be sure to reinitiate your auto-attacks as you are starting your Technical Step (i.e. for keyboard + mouse: right click Shiva as you are doing your steps). You lose about 2 auto-attacks if you don’t do this.
* The first reopener listed is for the most ideal case where you come into Shiva with maximum resources (4 Feathers and 100 Esprit). Technical Finish and Devilment are done first to get those strong raid buffs to the party to line up with other raid buffs and other jobs’ reopeners. Saber Dance is done as the first GCD after Technical Finish to prevent losing Esprit from being capped while it is being generated by the Technical Finish buff. Standard Step is then done as soon as possible to get the Standard Step buff on both you and your Dance Partner. If you come out of add phase with not enough Esprit, you can do Standard Step right after Technical Finish to get the Standard Step buff out as soon as possible to you and your Dance Partner.
* For the remainder of the fight, keep all of your dances / Devilment / Flourish off cooldown as much as possible. Keep in mind that if kept off cooldown, the order of these abilities during the 2 minute burst cycles will be Technical Step before Devilment before Standard Step before Flourish (different than what it would be after a normal opener).
* Since Flourish was used after Standard Step in this reopener, for every subsequent Standard Step before Flourish, make sure to either use a proc (if you have one) or use Saber Dance (similar to how you would use Saber as the filler GCD before Flourish under normal circumstances) on the GCD before you use Standard Step. This will prevent Flourish from being delayed.
* For Mirror, Mirror #5 (Lookaway Mirrors) consider saving the Rising Windmill proc from the Flourish just before this mechanic so you can use that proc during the first Lookaway (using an AoE proc does not have you turn to face the target it is hitting, allowing you to use your GCD freely during that mechanic).
* For Mirror, Mirror #7 (Ice + Ahk Rhai Mirror) instead of sliding on the ice, when the red mirror pulses, you can weave an En Avant to propel yourself away from the baited Ahk Rhai AoEs. This will prevent a potential loss of a GCD from the sliding animation.
* After the Ice + Ahk Rhai Mirrors is the start of Wyrm’s Lament 2 which is when your last Technical Step / Devilment should be coming off cooldown. This lines up nicely with other party members’ raid buffs and should be your group’s third potion window (unless pushing a faster kill time).

# Eden’s Promise - a DNC’s Guide

# E9S-E12S

by Io Whitespirit (Faerie)

# FOREWORD

This is a general guide written for Dancers who are looking to optimize their performance in Eden’s Promise. Note that these are simply suggestions; for groups that know their precise kill times, other timings may be more ideal especially to allow for final burst and to line up with three minute buffs/pots. There are likely also variations of strategies which may either restrict the ability to do some of the following suggestions, or conversely allow for Technical windows I considered difficult in this document due to ongoing mechanics.

I’d like to thank all the other Dancer mentors and helpfuls on the Balance for their constant help and for their input on this guide, as a document like this wouldn’t be possible without their support. Thank you all for your work!

Without further ado, let’s get to it!

# E9S - CLOUD OF DARKNESS

## Overview

Despite being the introductory raid to the tier, optimizing it on Dancer has been somewhat challenging due to the fact both the 4:10 and the 6:10 Technical windows come up during mechanics which force the party apart. The rest of the fight is pretty straightforward.

## Technical Windows

There are a few recommended ways to handle Technical windows for this fight. The first is for kill times over 6:30; the second is in the situation where your group is killing between ~6:20-6:30; and the third is where your group is killing too fast to even allow for much of the six minute burst window.

### **1) Drifting to ensure the full group gets buffed**

0:07\
2:10\
4:17 (delay 3 GCDs)\
6:17\
8:17  

Pros:  

* Allows the entire group to be buffed under Technical Step for the Tiles mechanic.
* Allows the entire group to be buffed under Technical Step for the Towers mechanic.

Cons:    

* Requires coordination with the rest of your group with regards to raid buff timings.
* May lose some of the six minute Technical window if killing too fast.

### **2) No drift (somewhat speedy group)**

0:07\
2:10 (or 2:07)\
4:10 (or 4:07)\
6:10 (or 6:07)  

Pros:

* Allows for a more complete Technical window in a 6:20-6:30 kill time.

Cons:

* Depending on how Tiles is being handled, there is a 50% chance your Technical Finish will only hit at most 7 of 8 players.
* Depending on the Brambles strat, there is a high chance your Technical Finish will miss some players.

### **3) Gotta go fast (sub 6:20)**

0:07\
2:10 (or 3:07)\
5:07   

Pros:

* Lines up raid buffs as best as possible when a six minute burst window is no longer achievable.
* Allows for a burst window under second potion.

Cons:

* Loses a use of Technical at six minutes.

## Recommended Samba Timings

* ~0:23 - Catches the Protean and Pairs mechanics.
* ~2:30 - Catches the Wide Angle/Anti-Air.
* ~4:30 - Catches the Deluge of Darkness.
* ~6:30 - Catches the Wide Angle/Anti-Air
* ~9:00 - Catches the second Art of Darkness.

## Potion Timings

The standard timings for the 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here. Use with the 5 minute window if doing speeds and skipping the 6 minute burst window.

## Adds

If your group is not planning to intentionally let the adds get past, and you are on the outside, you can cleave both the add and the boss by standing on the pattern below once the add has spawned and has traveled a short distance. Note: if you plan on using Fan Dance II, this is leading up to a Technical window, and you’ll need to assess if the 50 extra potency outside of raid buffs is worth it compared to dumping Fans with raid buffs at the 4 minute mark.

## If not drifting during Tiles

It is recommended you take either the eastern or western outside spots due to mobility, and because if people squeeze together a full 8/8 Technical Finish is possible 50% of the time:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/890372460451627038/unknown.png)\
*(Image was linked to me by Rah--original source is unknown to me. Although it mentions divination, the concept is the same)*

With some testing, I believe it is impossible to hit all 8 players with Technical Finish if you are the one being forced to move for the half-arena cleave (without significant effort being made by your other players). The length of each tile appears to be 8 yalms, meaning that despite what the following image shows, Technical Finish would miss on the south healer:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/890372497990627328/unknown.png)\
*(Again, I am unsure on the original source of this image)*

If someone has a log proving otherwise, please DM me at io#4617.

At the end of the day, this only occurs 50% of the time, and you’ll still be hitting 7 of the 8 players. For the vast majority of players, however, your kill time will likely allow you to drift Technical as previously recommended, and this entire section will not be a consideration. 

# E10S - SHADOWKEEPER

## Overview

This is a pretty straightforward fight until Shackled Apart and the final Void Gates. I’ll try to address some points, but the latter mechanic depends significantly on the strategy your group/PF plans on employing.
That, or you could just skip it.

## Technical Windows

There are two recommended ways of handling Technical windows for this fight, and both boil down to what you want to do at Shackled Apart. I have included a third option for speed kills.

### 1) Drifting to ensure the full group gets buffed

0:07\
2:10\
4:10\
6:10\
8:20 (delay four GCDs)\
10:20  

Pros:

* Allows the entire group to be buffed.
* Easier to execute (waits until shackles have faded).

Cons:

* Delays raid buffs.
* May lose some of the last Technical window if killing too fast.

### 2) No drift (step into boss hitbox briefly to pop Technical Finish; see later on alternative)

0:07\
2:10\
4:10\
6:10\
8:10\
10:10  

Pros:

* Allows the entire group to be buffed.
* Does not delay raid buffs.

Cons:

* Requires the party to be cognizant and to stay close enough to the boss hitbox.
* Can proc the shackled mechanic if not careful or if unlucky with server ticks.

### 3) Sub 8:20 kill-time

0:07\
3:07 (or 3:10)\
5:07 (or 5:10)\
7:10 (Pitch Bog resolves at 7:07)  

Pros:

* Allows for better alignment with 3 minute raid-buffs.

Cons:

* Loses a Technical Step at 8 minutes.

## Recommended Samba Timings

* If looking to cheese second orbs:

  * 1:28 - Catches the entirety of Dualspell.
  * 3:45 - Catches the frontal Shadow Implosion as well as orbs.
  * 7:17 or 7:40 - Catches either orbs, or the raidwide.
  * 10:25 - Catches the raidwide.
* If not cheesing second orbs but unwilling to do extremely tight timings for an extra use:

  * 1:28 - Catches the entirety of Dualspell.
  * 5:17 - Catches the raidwide.
  * 7:17 or 7:40 - Catches either orbs, or the raidwide.
  * 10:25 - Catches the raidwide.
* If looking to maximize uses (note that these timings are TIGHT and may not work if Standard Step ends up drifted):

  * 1:23 - Catches most of the Dualspell stacks/spreads.
  * 3:23 - Catches the orbs.
  * 5:23 - Catches the raidwide.
  * 7:43 - Catches the raidwide.
  * 10:25 - Catches the raidwide.

Realistically, I would suggest the first or second option.

Per Ringabel:\
*“I actually found using Samba for Umbral Slashes (tank buster + either tank buster / AoE damage) to be better for our group, since the follow-up damage is random whether it’s tank buster or AoE soak so tank cooldowns were not consistent.”*

## Potion Timings

The standard 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here. There is potential room for a third potion at the end if your group is significantly struggling with DPS.

## Shackled Apart

If unwilling to drift Technical Step and also unwilling to take the risk of stepping into the boss hitbox, an alternative option exists:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/890372763959848991/unknown.png)\
*(Image courtesy of Ringabel)*

This makes the Tank/Healer tethered to the Dancer rotate to one side, allowing the Dancer to pop Technical Finish to ensure it hits at least 7 players.

## Final Void Gates

Assuming you aren’t just skipping the mechanic, the end of the fight depends heavily on how your party’s plans on resolving Void Gates. Getting your melee procs in can be challenging if you’re executing one of the strategies where you take a ranged position and run along the outside of the arena from corner to corner.\
I am unable to cover what to do about your Flourish procs in all scenarios given the wide variation of strategies, but unfortunately if using a Void Gate strategy which prevents you from being close to the boss during Flourish, your options are limited to:

* Running briefly into range to use the melee procs
* Delaying Flourish
* Taking a melee spot
* Using a different strategy
* Skipping the mechanic

# E11S - FATEBREAKER

## Overview

Probably the most comfortable fight for Dancer this tier. Downtimes come up at exactly the right times, allowing for optimal pre-dances. Also good for short Improvisations.

## Dance Prep Timings

Probably the most common question for this fight is, “at what point do I start my dances during downtime?” Here are some general timings that are close to -15s that I personally use:

* First downtime: Standard Step can be started pretty much as it comes off cooldown, especially if drifted anywhere up to this point. May need to be delayed half a second if not drifting.
* Second downtime: Start the dance immediately as the dark-blue 270 degree arena-wide AoE from the serpent goes out.
* Prismatic downtime: Do a filler GCD AoE when the second ghost appears, then start SS (credit to Zeet#0269 for figuring out this timing early week 1).

## Technical Windows

This fight has some interesting options for Technical windows. The two minute Technical window should not be delayed by a GCD as is normally suggested, as it will result in the loss of 1 GCD in the Technical window before first Shifting Skies. Past that point, it depends if you want to pre-dance Technical during downtime, or if you just want to do the usual -15s Standard Step into Technical much like a regular opener.

### 1) Prepping Standard Step during downtime

0:07\
2:07\
4:10/4:35 (4:35 is almost universally better in a static as it lines up with pots)\
6:35 (delayed by downtime)\
9:07 (delayed by downtime)\
11:07  

Pros:

* Allows for an easily executed second potion if potting on cooldown.
* Still able to get a full Technical window off up to resolution of enrage (which occurs around 11:30).
  Cons:
* Does not allow for an extra Double Standard Step before Prismatic. Theoretically, you could finish on a Single Standard Step instead, but this will replace using the last couple GCDs for dumping any remaining procs or Esprit before downtime occurs.
* Timing is slightly behind the second option which may affect certain kill times.

### 2) Prepping Technical Step during downtime

0:07\
2:07\
4:10/4:28\
6:28 (delayed by downtime)\
9:00 (delayed by downtime)\
11:00  

Pros:

* Gets Technical out faster in compositions where the other party members want to dump resources immediately post-downtime.
* Windows are slightly earlier compared to above.

Cons:

* May be less optimal for certain classes that have to rebuild buffs post-downtime (e.g. SAM, etc.)
* Pot timing at 4:25 is a bit of a mess if using the third Technical Step early to allow for the fourth Technical at 6:28.

### 3) Combination of the two

As there is enough downtime between each mechanic, it is possible to mix and match the aforementioned Dance preps depending on what is best for your group and kill time. I would personally suggest prepping Standard Step during second downtime to allow for the 4:25 potion, and prepping Technical Step during Prismatic as groups are now killing within 20 seconds of Prismatic finishing.

## Standard Step

Making sure Standard Step is not drifted at all until the six minute mark can garner you an extra use. It’s up to you to decide whether or not the potency gain from the extra dance is worth the potential potency loss of not delaying Standard Step in any of the Technical windows up to this point (in cases of excess Esprit, or simply human error).

## Recommended Samba Timings

There are many possibilities; adjust to your healers’ requests. Here are my general timings:

* ~0:47 - Catches the elemental tether and the Burnished Glory.
* ~3:10 - Catches the proteans with its respective fire/lightning mechanic, and if done late enough in the cast will also catch the subsequent Burnished Glory.
* ~5:27 - Catches the Holy explosion and the subsequent Proteans with its respective fire/lightning mechanic.
* ~7:47 - Catches the Holy/Fire tether during Mirrors.
* ~9:47+ - Use it either late during the Holy cycle, or to cover the proteans during Lightning cycles. You can also choose to catch a specific Burnished Glory, and if casted late enough, it should cover the Proteans for the following cycle.

## Potion Timings

* If killing just before enrage, pot at -0:02, 6:xx, and 11:xx.
* If killing faster than that, pot at -0:06, 4:25, and 8:55 (pot on cooldown). The boss is targetable at 8:58, hence the need for an earlier than usual pre-pull potion.

## Improvisation Timings

* 2:32 - First downtime, while waiting to be knocked back.
* 5:57 - Second downtime, while waiting to be knocked back. Note that you need to position yourself to be knocked back the correct direction before you start channeling.
  An alternative to this is waiting until everyone is stacked together and praying that you don’t get the holy tether. This gets more ticks than doing it before the knockback, but as at least one player is not stacked with the group you will not be getting a full 10 esprit per tick.
* 8:30 - During prismatic, while waiting for the first ghosts to resolve. The more players you can get to join you, the better.

# E12S DOOR - EDEN’S PROMISE

## Overview

Fairly horrendous fight for Dancers while on enrage to clear. Gets much better after that.
That’s all, really.

## Technical Windows

Your technical windows will vary drastically depending on your goals.

### 1) I want to parse well and my group is having issues maintaining full uptime during mechanics

0:07\
2:30 (or 3:00)\
4:30 (or 5:00)\
6:30 (or 7:00, or even 7:30)  

Pros:

* Raid buffs are delayed, allowing players who have trouble with uptime during Junction - Shiva and Lions to worry about it after the fact.
* Much easier to execute and to make sure all players are affected by Technical Finish.

Cons:

* Raid buffs are delayed, resulting in the loss of a full Technical window at the end.

### 2) JUST LET ME CLEAR PLEASE I BEG YOU (extended explanations below)

0:07\
2:10 (or 2:07*)\
4:10 (or 4:07*)\
6:10 (or 6:07*)\
8:10 (or 8:07*)\
*These timings are only possible if your party runs in immediately during Shiva junction and you either have a melee spot or are able to En Avant back to middle quickly. In a non-organized environment, using it at 2:07 is likely going to cause it to whiff on one or more players.*

Pros:

* Does not delay raid buffs, allowing for nearly a full Technical window before enrage. If your goal is simply to clear E12S and your group is struggling with enrage, use this.

Cons:

* Requires much higher execution to perform correctly.
* Unlikely to get you a very good parse compared to option #1 as you might lose part of your 8 minute Technical window anyways.

### Execution:

* 2:10 - For the few GCDs prior to starting Technical Step, always wait for your GCD to go out before sliding. Delaying Technical Step a GCD and switching over to a Devilment before Flourish re-opener is likely ideal here as there is otherwise a high chance of whiffing Technical on multiple players. This does shave off a bit of your 8 minute Technical window, so avoiding the drift is better if your party is willing to accommodate.

  * Example Technical window from one of my early logs:

  * Note that I used Arm’s Length; if you choose to be intentionally knocked back to the correct position, you will gain an extra weave slot.
* 6:10 - Possibly the worst window, as Arm’s Length needs to be used at the same time you are likely performing your Technical dance.

  * Example Technical window from one of my early logs: ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/890373394095308800/unknown.png)
  * To prevent knockback, Arm’s Length needs to be used during the single-weave slot immediately after Technical Finish. From first-hand experience, trying to greed devilment first will not work. If Technical Step is accidentally delayed by an extra GCD, you can instead weave Arm’s Length on initiation of Technical Step.
  * If you did not delay a GCD during Junction Shiva, this window will obviously become much easier to manage, as you can do a normal re-opener and Arm’s Length the following GCD.

## Recommended Samba Timings

There are many viable timings for Samba this fight. My group’s healing and mitigation plan was made while we were still doing Technical windows during Junction Shiva, and so I had requested not to have Samba placed there due to it being an already very busy window.  

My group’s plan is as follows:

* 0:42 - Covers the Shiva/Titan stacks/spreads.
* 3:00 - Covers the Earthen Fury, and if done late enough, the first Titan markers.
* 6:00 - Covers most of the Lions mechanic.
* 8:00 - Covers the Obliterations Maleficums at the end.

Realistically, if not using Technical Step during Shiva, you could use Samba there instead and adjust the rest of the timings accordingly.

Per Ringabel, his group’s plan is as follows:

* 2:10 - After icicles drop, but before knockback damage.
* 4:18 - Covers both Obliterations Maleficums.
* 7:14 - Covers the Shiva/Titan mechanic with Obliteration Maleficum.

## Potion Timings

The standard 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here. If delaying raid-buffs to after Junction Shiva, pots can also be used for a 4:30 or 5:00 burst window.

# E12S - ORACLE OF DARKNESS

## Overview

Home stretch! Unlike the door boss, this is a more comfortable fight.

## Technical Windows

Once again, there are a few options to using Technical Step.

### 1) Prioritizing Standard Step

0:07\
2:21 (delayed by downtime)\
4:24 (delayed by downtime)\
6:35 (delayed by downtime)\
8:35  

Pros:

* Allows for two Standard Finishes under the 6 minute pot window.
* Still able to get a full Technical window off up to resolution of enrage (which occurs around 8:54).

Cons:

* Timing is slightly behind the second option which may affect certain kill times.

#### Execution:

2:21 - Once Basic Relativity resolves, immediately start Technical Step.\
4:24 - Once Intermediate Relativity resolves, immediately start Technical Step.\
6:35 - Start Standard Step immediately before getting stunned by Advanced Relativity. Once the mechanic resolves, you should have enough time to finish the dance steps and pot while the boss is still untargetable. Pop Standard Finish, and then go into Technical Step as per usual.

### 2) Prioritizing Technical Step

0:07\
2:16-2:19 (delayed by downtime)\
4:22 (delayed by downtime)\
6:28 (delayed by downtime)\
8:28 (delayed by downtime)  

Pros:

* Gets Technical out faster in compositions where the other party members want to dump resources immediately post-downtime.
* Windows are slightly earlier compared to above.

Cons:

* May be less optimal for certain classes that have to rebuild buffs post-downtime (e.g. SAM, etc.)
* The 6 minute Technical Finish can be tight to get off without dropping the dance, and potting before the boss is targetable is not possible.

#### Execution:

2:16-2:19 - Start Technical Step one to two GCDs before Basic Relativity resolves.\
4:22 - Start Technical Step shortly before Intermediate Relativity resolves.\
6:28 - Start Technical Step immediately before getting stunned by Advanced Relativity. Once the mechanic resolves, you should have enough time to finish the dance steps while the boss is still untargetable.

### 3) Combination of the two

It is possible to mix and match the aforementioned Dance preps depending on what is best for your group and kill time.

## Recommended Samba Timings

Two options for the first Samba:

* 1:02 - Catches Darkest Dance and the subsequent stack/spread.
* 1:30 - Catches Basic Relativity.
* 3:35 - Catches Intermediate Relativity.
* 5:40 - Catches Advanced Relativity.
* 7:48 - Catches Terminal Relativity. Delay the cast to help catch some of the subsequent raidwides. Can be moved based on your mitigation plan.

## Potion Timings

The standard 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here.

## Improvisation Timings

* 1:40 - Helps with healing up Basic Relativity.
* 3:45 - Helps with healing up Intermediate Relativity
* 5:55 - Helps with healing up Advanced Relativity, and is a period of downtime.
* 8:xx - Useful to flash prior to one of the Pulsars to help the healers.

Curing Waltz

* Specific to this fight, Curing Waltz can be a gigantic help to your healers post-Shell Crushers. **Don’t forget to use it!**

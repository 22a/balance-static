Eden’s Promise - a DNC’s Guide
E9S-E12S

by Io Whitespirit (Faerie)

FOREWORD

This is a general guide written for Dancers who are looking to optimize their performance in Eden’s Promise. Note that these are simply suggestions; for groups that know their precise kill times, other timings may be more ideal especially to allow for final burst and to line up with 3 minute buffs/pots. There are likely also variations of strategies which may either restrict the ability to do some of the following suggestions, or conversely allow for Technical windows I considered difficult in this document due to ongoing mechanics.

I’d like to thank all the other Dancer mentors and helpfuls on the Balance for their constant help and for their input on this guide, as a document like this wouldn’t be possible without their support. Thank you all for your work!

Without further ado, let’s get to it!




E9S - CLOUD OF DARKNESS

Overview
Despite being the introductory raid to the tier, optimizing it on Dancer has been somewhat challenging due to the fact both the 4:10 and the 6:10 Technical windows come up during mechanics which force the party apart. The rest of the fight is pretty straightforward.

Technical Windows
There are a few recommended ways to handle Technical windows for this fight. The first is for kill times over 6:30; the second is in the situation where your group is killing between ~6:20-6:30; and the third is where your group is killing too fast to even allow for much of the 6 minute burst window.

1) Drifting to ensure the full group gets buffed
0:07
2:10
4:17 (delay three GCDs)
6:17
8:17

Pros:
Allows the entire group to be buffed under Technical Step for the Tiles mechanic.
Allows the entire group to be buffed under Technical Step for the Towers mechanic.
Cons:
Requires coordination with the rest of your group with regards to raid buff timings.
May lose some of the 6 minute Technical window if killing too fast.


2) No drift (somewhat speedy group)
0:07
2:10 (or 2:07)
4:10 (or 4:07)
6:10 (or 6:07)

Pros:
Allows for a more complete Technical window in a 6:20-6:30 kill time.

Cons:
Depending on how Tiles is being handled, there is a 50% chance your Technical Finish will only hit at most 7 of 8 players.
Depending on the Brambles strat, there is a high chance your Technical Finish will miss some players.

3) Gotta go fast (sub 6:20)
0:07
2:10 (or 3:07)
5:07 

Pros:
Lines up raid buffs as best as possible when a 6 minute burst window is no longer achievable.
Allows for a burst window under second potion.

Cons:
Loses a use of Technical at 6 minutes.

Recommended Samba Timings
~0:23 - Catches the Protean and Pairs mechanics.
~2:30 - Catches the Wide Angle/Anti-Air.
~4:30 - Catches the Deluge of Darkness.
~6:30 - Catches the Wide Angle/Anti-Air
~9:00 - Catches the second Art of Darkness.

Potion Timings
The standard timings for the 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here. Use with the 5 minute window if doing speeds and skipping the 6 minute burst window.

Adds
If your group is not planning to intentionally let the adds get past, and you are on the outside, you can cleave both the add and the boss by standing on the pattern below once the add has spawned and has traveled a short distance. Note: if you plan on using Fan Dance II, this is leading up to a Technical window, and you’ll need to assess if the 50 extra potency outside of raid buffs is worth it compared to dumping fans with raid buffs at the 4 minute mark.



If not drifting during Tiles 
It is recommended you take either the eastern or western outside spots due to mobility, and because if people squeeze together a full 8/8 Technical Finish is possible 50% of the time:

(Image was linked to me by Rah--original source is unknown to me. Although it mentions divination, the concept is the same)

With some testing, I believe it is impossible to hit all 8 players with Technical Finish if you are the one being forced to move for the half-arena cleave (without significant effort being made by your other players). The length of each tile appears to be 8 yalms, meaning that despite what the following image shows, Technical Finish would miss on the south healer:

(Again, I am unsure on the original source of this image)

If someone has a log proving otherwise, please DM me at io#4617.
At the end of the day, this only occurs 50% of the time, and you’ll still be hitting 7 of the 8 players. For the vast majority of players, however, your kill time will likely allow you to drift Technical as previously recommended, and this entire section will not be a consideration. 

E10S - SHADOWKEEPER

Overview
This is a pretty straightforward fight until Shackled Apart and the final Void Gates. I’ll try to address some points, but the latter mechanic depends significantly on the strategy your group/PF plans on employing.
That, or you could just skip it.

Technical Windows
There are two recommended ways of handling Technical windows for this fight, and both boil down to what you want to do at Shackled Apart. I have included a third option for speed kills.

1) Drifting to ensure the full group gets buffed
0:07
2:10
4:10
6:10
8:20 (delay four GCDs)
10:20

Pros:
Allows the entire group to be buffed.
Easier to execute (waits until shackles have faded).
Cons:
Delays raid buffs.
May lose some of the last Technical window if killing too fast.


2) No drift (step into boss hitbox briefly to pop Technical Finish; see later on alternative)
0:07
2:10
4:10
6:10
8:10
10:10

Pros:
Allows the entire group to be buffed.
Does not delay raid buffs.

Cons:
Requires the party to be cognizant and to stay close enough to the boss hitbox.
Can proc the shackled mechanic if not careful or if unlucky with server ticks.

3) Sub 8:20 kill-time
0:07
3:07 (or 3:10)
5:07 (or 5:10)
7:10 (Pitch Bog resolves at 7:07)

Pros:
Allows for better alignment with 3 minute raid-buffs.

Cons:
Loses a Technical Step at 8 minutes.

Recommended Samba Timings
If looking to cheese second orbs:
1:28 - Catches the entirety of Dualspell.
3:45 - Catches the frontal Shadow Implosion as well as orbs.
7:17 or 7:40 - Catches either orbs, or the raidwide.
10:25 - Catches the raidwide.
If not cheesing second orbs but unwilling to do extremely tight timings for an extra use:
1:28 - Catches the entirety of Dualspell.
5:17 - Catches the raidwide.
7:17 or 7:40 - Catches either orbs, or the raidwide.
10:25 - Catches the raidwide.
If looking to maximize uses (note that these timings are TIGHT and may not work if Standard Step ends up drifted):
1:23 - Catches most of the Dualspell stacks/spreads.
3:23 - Catches the orbs.
5:23 - Catches the raidwide.
7:43 - Catches the raidwide.
10:25 - Catches the raidwide.

Realistically, I would suggest the first or second option.

Per Ringabel:
“I actually found using Samba for Umbral Slashes (tank buster + either tank buster / aoe damage) to be better for our group, since the follow-up damage is random whether it’s tank buster or AoE soak so tank cooldowns were not consistent.”

Potion Timings
The standard 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here. There is potential room for a third potion at the end if your group is significantly struggling with DPS.


Shackled Apart
If unwilling to drift Technical Step and also unwilling to take the risk of stepping into the boss hitbox, an alternative option exists:

(Image courtesy of Ringabel)

This makes the Tank/Healer tethered to the Dancer rotate to one side, allowing the Dancer to pop Technical Finish to ensure it hits at least 7 players.

Final Void Gates
Assuming you aren’t just skipping the mechanic, the end of the fight depends heavily on how your party’s plans on resolving Void Gates. Getting your melee procs in can be challenging if you’re executing one of the strategies where you take a ranged position and run along the outside of the arena from corner to corner. I am unable to cover what to do about your flourish procs in all scenarios given the wide variation of strategies, but unfortunately if using a Void Gate strategy which prevents you from being close to the boss during Flourish, your options are limited to:
Running briefly into range to use the melee procs
Delaying flourish
Taking a melee spot
Using a different strategy
Skipping the mechanic

E11S - FATEBREAKER

Overview
Probably the most comfortable fight for Dancer this tier. Downtimes come up at exactly the right times, allowing for optimal pre-dances. Also good for short Improvisations.

Dance Prep Timings
Probably the most common question for this fight is, “at what point do I start my dances during downtime?” Here are some general timings that are close to -15s that I personally use:

First downtime: Standard Step can be started pretty much as it comes off cooldown, especially if drifted anywhere up to this point. May need to be delayed half a second if not drifting.

Second downtime: Start the dance immediately as the dark-blue 270 degree arena-wide AoE from the serpent goes out.

Prismatic downtime: Do a filler GCD AoE when the second ghost appears, then start SS (credit to Zeet#0269 for figuring out this timing early week 1).

Technical Windows
This fight has some interesting options for Technical windows. The 2 minute Technical window should not be delayed by a GCD as is normally suggested, as it will result in the loss of one GCD in the Technical window before first Shifting Skies. Past that point, it depends if you want to pre-dance Technical during downtime, or if you just want to do the usual -15s Standard Step into Technical much like a regular opener.

1) Prepping Standard Step during downtime
0:07
2:07
4:10/4:35 (4:35 is almost universally better in a static as it lines up with pots)
6:35 (delayed by downtime)
9:07 (delayed by downtime)
11:07

Pros:
Allows for an easily executed second potion if potting on cooldown.
Still able to get a full Technical window off up to resolution of enrage (which occurs around 11:30).
Cons:
Does not allow for an extra Double Standard Step before Prismatic. Theoretically, you could finish on a Single Standard Step instead, but this will replace using the last couple GCDs for dumping any remaining procs or Esprit before downtime occurs.
Timing is slightly behind the second option which may affect certain kill times.
2) Prepping Technical Step during downtime 
0:07
2:07
4:10/4:28
6:28 (delayed by downtime)
9:00 (delayed by downtime)
11:00

Pros:
Gets Technical out faster in compositions where the other party members want to dump resources immediately post-downtime.
Windows are slightly earlier compared to above.
Cons:
May be less optimal for certain classes that have to rebuild buffs post-downtime (e.g. SAM, etc.)
Pot timing at 4:25 is a bit of a mess if using the third Technical Step early to allow for the fourth Technical at 6:28.

3) Combination of the two
As there is enough downtime between each mechanic, it is possible to mix and match the aforementioned Dance preps depending on what is best for your group and kill time. I would personally suggest prepping Standard Step during second downtime to allow for the 4:25 potion, and prepping Technical Step during Prismatic as groups are now killing within 20 seconds of Prismatic finishing.

Standard Step
Making sure Standard Step is not drifted at all until the 6 minute mark can garner you an extra use. It’s up to you to decide whether or not the potency gain from the extra dance is worth the potential potency loss of not delaying Standard Step in any of the Technical windows up to this point (in cases of excess Esprit, or simply human error).

Recommended Samba Timings
There are many possibilities; adjust to your healers’ requests. Here are my general timings:

~0:47 - Catches the elemental tether and the Burnished Glory.
~3:10 - Catches the proteans with its respective fire/lightning mechanic, and if done late enough in the cast will also catch the subsequent Burnished Glory.
~5:27 - Catches the Holy explosion and the subsequent proteans with its respective fire/lightning mechanic.
~7:47 - Catches the Holy/Fire tether during Mirrors.
~9:47+ - Use it either late during the Holy cycle, or to cover the proteans during Lightning cycles. You can also choose to catch a specific Burnished Glory, and if casted late enough, it should cover the Proteans for the following cycle.

Potion Timings
If killing just before enrage, pot at -0:02, 6:xx, and 11:xx.
If killing faster than that, pot at -0:06, 4:25, and 8:55 (pot on cooldown). The boss is targetable at 8:58, hence the need for an earlier than usual pre-pull potion.

Improvisation Timings
2:32 - First downtime, while waiting to be knocked back.
5:57 - Second downtime, while waiting to be knocked back. Note that you need to position yourself to be knocked back the correct direction before you start channeling.
An alternative to this is waiting until everyone is stacked together and praying that you don’t get the holy tether. This gets more ticks than doing it before the knockback, but as at least one player is not stacked with the group you will not be getting a full 10 esprit per tick.
8:30 - During prismatic, while waiting for the first ghosts to resolve. The more players you can get to join you, the better.

E12S DOOR - EDEN’S PROMISE

Overview
Fairly horrendous fight for Dancers while on enrage to clear. Gets much better after that.
That’s all, really.

Technical Windows
Your technical windows will vary drastically depending on your goals.

1) I want to parse well and my group is having issues maintaining full uptime during mechanics
0:07
2:30 (or 3:00)
4:30 (or 5:00)
6:30 (or 7:00, or even 7:30)

Pros:
Raid buffs are delayed, allowing players who have trouble with uptime during Junction Shiva and Lions to worry about it after the fact.
Much easier to execute and to make sure all players are affected by Technical Finish.
Cons:
Raid buffs are delayed, resulting in the loss of a full Technical window at the end.


2) JUST LET ME CLEAR PLEASE I BEG YOU (extended explanations below)
0:07
2:10 (or 2:07*)
4:10 (or 4:07*)
6:10 (or 6:07*)
8:10 (or 8:07*)
* These timings are only possible if your party runs in immediately during Shiva junction and you either have a melee spot or are able to En Avant back to middle quickly. In a non-organized environment, using it at 2:07 is likely going to cause it to whiff on one or more players.

Pros:
Does not delay raid buffs, allowing for nearly a full Technical window before enrage. If your goal is simply to clear E12S and your group is struggling with enrage, use this.

Cons:
Requires much higher execution to perform correctly.
Unlikely to get you a very good parse compared to option #1 as you might lose part of your 8 minute Technical window anyways.

Execution:
2:10 - For the few GCDs prior to starting Technical Step, always wait for your GCD to go out before sliding. Delaying Technical Step a GCD and switching over to a Devilment before Flourish re-opener is likely ideal here as there is otherwise a high chance of whiffing Technical on multiple players. This does shave off a bit of your 8 minute Technical window, so avoiding the drift is better if your party is willing to accommodate.
Example Technical window from one of my early logs:

Note that I used Arm’s Length; if you choose to be intentionally knocked back to the correct position, you will gain an extra weave slot.
6:10 - Possibly the worst window, as Arm’s Length needs to be used at the same time you are likely performing your Technical dance.
Example Technical window from one of my early logs:

To prevent knockback, Arm’s Length needs to be used during the single-weave slot immediately after Technical Finish. From first-hand experience, trying to greed devilment first will not work. If Technical Step is accidentally delayed by an extra GCD, you can instead weave Arm’s Length on initiation of Technical Step.
If you did not delay a GCD during Junction Shiva, this window will obviously become much easier to manage, as you can do a normal re-opener and Arm’s Length the following GCD.

Recommended Samba Timings
There are many viable timings for Samba this fight. My group’s healing and mitigation plan was made while we were still doing Technical windows during Junction Shiva, and so I had requested not to have Samba placed there due to it being an already very busy window.

My group’s plan is as follows:
0:42 - Covers the Shiva/Titan stacks/spreads.
3:00 - Covers the Earthen Fury, and if done late enough, the first Titan markers.
6:00 - Covers most of the Lions mechanic.
8:00 - Covers the Obliterations Maleficums at the end.

Realistically, if not using Technical Step during Shiva, you could use Samba there instead and adjust the rest of the timings accordingly.

Per Ringabel, his group’s plan is as follows:
2:10 - After icicles drop, but before knockback damage.
4:18 - Covers both Obliterations Maleficums.
7:14 - Covers the Shiva/Titan mechanic with Obliteration Maleficum.

Potion Timings
The standard 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here. If delaying raid-buffs to after Junction Shiva, pots can also be used for a 4:30 or 5:00 burst window.
E12S - ORACLE OF DARKNESS

Overview
Home stretch! Unlike the door boss, this is a more comfortable fight.

Technical Windows
Once again, there are a few options to using Technical Step.

1) Prioritizing Standard Step
0:07
2:21 (delayed by downtime)
4:24 (delayed by downtime)
6:35 (delayed by downtime)
8:35

Pros:
Allows for two Standard Finishes under the 6 minute pot window.
Still able to get a full Technical window off up to resolution of enrage (which occurs around 8:54).

Cons:
Timing is slightly behind the second option which may affect certain kill times.

Execution:
2:21 - Once Basic Relativity resolves, immediately start Technical Step.
4:24 - Once Intermediate Relativity resolves, immediately start Technical Step.
6:35 - Start Standard Step immediately before getting stunned by Advanced Relativity. Once the mechanic resolves, you should have enough time to finish the dance steps and pot while the boss is still untargetable. Pop Standard Finish, and then go into Technical Step as per usual.

2) Prioritizing Technical Step
0:07
2:16-2:19 (delayed by downtime)
4:22 (delayed by downtime)
6:28 (delayed by downtime)
8:28 (delayed by downtime)

Pros:
Gets Technical out faster in compositions where the other party members want to dump resources immediately post-downtime.
Windows are slightly earlier compared to above.
Cons:
May be less optimal for certain classes that have to rebuild buffs post-downtime (e.g. SAM, etc.)
The 6 minute Technical Finish can be tight to get off without dropping the dance, and potting before the boss is targetable is not possible.

Execution:
2:16-2:19 - Start Technical Step one to two GCDs before Basic Relativity resolves.
4:22 - Start Technical Step shortly before Intermediate Relativity resolves.
6:28 - Start Technical Step immediately before getting stunned by Advanced Relativity. Once the mechanic resolves, you should have enough time to finish the dance steps while the boss is still untargetable.

3) Combination of the two
It is possible to mix and match the aforementioned Dance preps depending on what is best for your group and kill time.

Recommended Samba Timings
Two options for the first Samba:
1:02 - Catches Darkest Dance and the subsequent stack/spread.
1:30 - Catches Basic Relativity.
3:35 - Catches Intermediate Relativity.
5:40 - Catches Advanced Relativity.
7:48 - Catches Terminal Relativity. Delay the cast to help catch some of the subsequent raidwides. Can be moved based on your mitigation plan.

Potion Timings
The standard 0 minute window and 6:xx window are fine here.

Improvisation Timings
1:40 - Helps with healing up Basic Relativity.
3:45 - Helps with healing up Intermediate Relativity
5:55 - Helps with healing up Advanced Relativity, and is a period of downtime.
8:xx - Useful to flash prior to one of the Pulsars to help the healers.

Curing Waltz
Specific to this fight, Curing Waltz can be a gigantic help to your healers post-Shell Crushers. Don’t forget to use it!

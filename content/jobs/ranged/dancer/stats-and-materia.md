# What to do with iLvl 535 DNC Relic

It’s BiS for current Savage content and for old iLvl synced content. 

## For current level 80 content:

If you are missing other items for BiS, a good starting point is maxing CRIT and DH and putting the rest in DET. You can min/max your relic for your needs by plugging your gear into <https://etro.gg/> and watching for wasted secondary stats. To minimize wasted stats, reallocate secondary stats from Crit that go above current stat tier into DET and then adjust DET/DH distribution until total wasted secondary stats is less than 6. Keep in mind you'll have to do this every time you get a gear upgrade. Staying with max Crit / max DH / rest DET while gearing up is fine too.

## For 5.55 BiS: (see gearset in BiS section)

DH = 358, Crit = 523, DET = 301, SkS = 0

## For TEA: (see gearset in TEA section)

DH = 346, Crit = 452, DET = 384, SkS = 0

## For UCoB:

DH = 280, Crit = 342, DET = 280, SkS = 280 *Caps all 4 stats so the last 62 points don’t matter. 

## For UWU:

DH = 318, Crit = 318, DET = 318, SkS = 228 *Caps on DH / Crit / DET and rest in SkS

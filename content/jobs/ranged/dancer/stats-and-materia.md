# What to do with ilvl 535 DNC Relic
It’s BiS for current savage content and for old ilvl synced content. 
## For current level 80 content:
If you are missing other items for BiS, a good starting point is maxing CRIT and DH and putting the rest in DET. You can min/max your relic for your needs by plugging your gear into <https://etro.gg/> and watching for wasted secondary stats. To minimize wasted stats, reallocate secondary stats from crit that go above current stat tier into DET and then adjust DET/DH distribution until total wasted secondary stats is less than 6. Keep in mind you'll have to do this every time you get a gear upgrade. Staying with max Crit / max DH / rest DET while gearing up is fine too.


## For 5.55 BiS: (see gearset in BiS section)
DH = 358, Crit = 523, Det = 301, SkS = 0


## For TEA: (see gearset in TEA section)
DH = 346, Crit = 452, Det = 384, SkS = 0


## For UCoB: 
DH = 280, Crit = 342, Det = 280, SkS = 280 *Caps all 4 stats so the last 62 points don’t matter. 


## For UWU: 
DH = 318, Crit = 318, Det = 318, SkS = 228 *Caps on DH / Crit / Det and rest in SkS


# ilvl 515 DNC Relic
## For current level 80 content: 
Staying with max Crit / max DH / rest DET while gearing up is fine.


## For TEA: (see gearset in TEA section)
DH = 407, Crit = 452, Det = 308, SkS = 0 

## For UCoB: 

DH = 280, Crit = 327, Det = 280, SkS = 280 *Caps on all 4 stats so last 47 points don’t matter. 


## For UWU: 
DH = 314, Crit = 318, Det = 318, SkS = 217 *4 points are moved from DH cap to SkS to reach an extra GCD tier (2.46 vs. 2.47)

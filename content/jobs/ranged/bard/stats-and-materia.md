# Stat Priority

**ITEM LEVEL** ( = Weapon Damage and Dexterity) is top priority!

Substats (mostly close aside from SkS)

1. Critical Hit
2. Direct Hit
3. Determination
4. Skill Speed

If you have all the pieces for BiS, follow the BiS set's melds. Otherwise, use the above priorities.

Make sure to stay under the substat cap when melding! If the number is red, don't do it.

# Weapon Ranking

* Final relic (i535)
* Edenmorn (i535)
* Augmented cryptlurker (i530)
* Diamond Zeta (i525)
* Augmented relic (i515), augmented exarchic (i520), unaugmented cryptlurker (i520) - about equal
* Unaugmented relic (i510), emerald (i515) - about equal
* Exarchic (i510)

# Stats FAQ

> *What do I put in my relic?*\

If you have the 535 AND the rest of the best in slot gear, or if you're using it for an Ultimate, check Gear Sets for details. Otherwise, follow the basic priority above.

> *Is piece x better than piece y?*\

The higher item level piece is better. If they're the same ilvl, the one with better substats (see priorities above) is better. A piece with more total substats (i.e. five meld slots) can be better than one the next ilvl step up, but usually they're roughly equal at best and you lose HP for it. 

> *Should I pentameld my crafted gear?*\

Pentamelding is only worth the gil sink if you're working on a Savage tier shortly after it releases. At this stage, you're better off talking to Hillicen to upgrade your crafted gear to i520 instead.

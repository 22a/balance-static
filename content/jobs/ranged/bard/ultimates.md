# TEA - The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)

As with any ultimate, mechanics are much more important than dps. But your group may set some phase push targets to skip certain things.


## Phases 1 + 2


- Song timings for the first two phases will vary with push timings. You'll have to feel it out for your group.

- Hold Sidewinder in the opener, so you can Shadowbite two targets once hand spawns.

- You can single or double DoT your doll, and/or find ways to Apex multiple dolls and/or bosses, lots of ways to do it. Whatever you do, prioritize consistency.

- Warden's Paean will cleanse Throttle, but only after it goes up. Make sure your healers know your target priority.

- If you're worried about hitting both bosses with Quick Nock or Apex, stand in one and aim at the other.

- Throughout the first two phases, both tanks are getting buster'd and auto'd, ask your healers where they want Minne.

- Troubadour recommendations:

   - Tons of good Troubadour options, ask your healers.


## Phase 3

- You can DoT and AP the heart to build gauge and set up WM to be available (via AP cooldown reduction) post-Wormhole.

- If you want to focus on J-Wave add damage, you can MB after Wormhole instead, and leverage the 6x DoTs for lots of PPs during J-Waves.

- It's 6x because you can Iron Jaws Alex before it goes immune. It won't deal damage but you can get procs.

- Stand in one enemy and target the other to hit both with Quick Nock / Apex during J-Waves. Rain of Death will not hit both.

- Troubadour recommendations:

   - Tetrashatter + Flamethrowers during Inception
   - Stack + Mega Holy, or both Mega Holy, or some part of J-Waves (ask healer) 


## Phase 4

- A good opening sequence is something like (if you saved Apex and BV) -

   - RS - SB (WM+BV) - CB (Pot) - Apex (Bar+EA) - RA (BL)

> Doing Barrage quickly here lets you get an extra Barrage in before Fate Calibration Alpha, which will net you an extra Barrage overall on most enrage-sequence pulls. 

> But, this comes at the cost of keeping it under buffs. So if you're re-clearing and don't expect to see the enrage, go ahead and keep it paired with Raging Strikes.

-  If your group wants to hold burst until after the forced march, you can start in AP and go into WM just before the march instead. You can still rush Barrage independently if you'd like.

-  You can carry DoTs through Fate Calibration Alpha. You can do so for Beta too, but it isn't much of a gain (if any at all) and not worth messing around with.

- As a just under 6 minute phase, you are free to hold your second Battle Voice for whatever the biggest buff stack is after Beta.

- Troubadour recommendations:

   - The first Optical Sights
   - One of the Irresistible Graces




# Level 70 Ultimates



- The dps checks in these fights are currently trivial (UCoB was killed with eight tanks!), so focus on mechanics and consistency (especially with your defensive skills) above all else. 


- On UWU, song cycles can vary a lot with party phase push timings, so you'll need to feel it out for your particular group's normal timings.


- On UCoB, you can carry your DoTs through all of the trios. Letting your DoTs run their course on the more-exactly 30 second uptimes is okay too. Don’t stress it too much either way, the trio dps check is basically non-existent.

- In the UCoB adds phase, Quick Nock and Rain of Death are gains, but don’t risk missing baits or causing any traffic jams just for the sake of Nock damage.

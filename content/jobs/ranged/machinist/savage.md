## E1S

### Damage Optimization

* **Stock Ricochet Charges for Adds Phase**

  * Try to enter adds phase with 2 charges of Ricochet stocked.

    * On 2 targets, Ricochet yields an additional 75 AoE potency per cast, for 150 free potency from stocked charges. Keep in mind that, depending on your opener, Ricochet’s natural cooldown may turn over during the pre-adds downtime.
* **Stock Heat for Adds Phase**

  * Try to enter adds phase with 85-100 heat.

    * By avoiding a Hypercharge following the two minute burst period, you should be able to enter adds phase with capped or nearly capped heat. Stocking and blowing heat during the adds phase will grant a lot of extra potency (up to 75 x 5 = 375). You have to overcap heat by more than 20 for this to stop being a gain - so don’t sweat overcapping a bit if it occurs.
* **Adds Phase Bioblaster**

  * In the adds phase, replace your first cast of Drill with Bioblaster.

    * On 2 targets, full duration Bioblaster is a 20 potency gain over Drill. Due to the duration of the phase, you are unlikely to get full DoT ticks twice, so use Drill normally when it comes back up.
* **Adds Phase Spread Shot**

  * In the adds phase, replace the 1-2-3 combo with Spread Shot when you know you will not reach Clean Shot before the phase ends.

    * On 2 targets, the heated combo is only a gain over Spread Shot when an entire 1-2-3 combo replaces 3 Spread Shots. Look at the expected duration of your adds phase. An Anchor, a Bioblaster, two Hypercharges, and a Drill take 22.5 sec. Optimized groups will kill the adds in approximately 25 sec, leaving you time for one or two additional GCDs. This means that you will be unable to finish your combo, making Spread Shot a gain of 140 or 170 potency, depending on whether you replaced 1 or 2 combo GCDs.
* **Avoid Queen in Adds Phase**

  * Save your Battery for after the cutscene.

    * Because the optimal adds phase generates only 20 battery, summoning Queen will prevent you from using her on the post-cutscene reopener sequence, which typically contains most/all of your group’s buffs.
* **Flamethrower After Cutscene**

  * Use flamethrower at least 2.5 sec before the boss becomes targetable.

    * It takes a moment to retarget the boss and hit a button. We can potentially take advantage of this time to get a lucky tick of Flamethrower. Under no circumstances should you delay getting into your normal rotation when the boss is back - this is just a passive channel (pointed at the boss) that may grant you 100 potency if your timing is good. This technique is useful after downtime in many circumstances, as described later in this guide. If you plan to use Reassemble on your first GCD after downtime, you can cast it before flamethrower without fear of losing the buff. You don’t want to do this at the start of adds phase, as you will get murdered by the proximity AoEs.
* **Stock Ricochet Charges for Meteors Phase**

  * Try to enter meteors phase with 2 charges of Ricochet stocked.

    * Each cast of Ricochet on a meteor will also hit the boss, for a total of 75 x 2 = 150 free potency.
* **Meteors Phase Spread Shot**

  * In the meteors phase, you can replace combo GCDs with Spread Shots.

    * With proper positioning, you can hit 3 targets with Spread Shot (boss + 2 meteors), making this a gain of 135 potency per GCD over the 1-2-3 combo. If you are on far orb baiting duty, you will only have time for 1-2 Spread Shots before you need to be in your bait position. Spread Shot breaks your combo, so only do this after finishing with Clean Shot.
* **Meteors Phase Bioblaster**

  * In the meteors phase, you can replace a cast of Drill with Bioblaster.

    * This is a bit risky, so look at how your group tends to kill the meteors before trying this. Hitting 3 targets with Bioblaster, you need 11 total ticks for this to be a gain over Drill. If we assume you’ll get the full 6 ticks on the boss, you’ll need 5 ticks between the two orbs. You will reach this point between 7 and 9 seconds after applying Bioblaster, depending on server tick timing. This is near typical orb lifespan, so apply with care. This is best applied if Bioblaster comes up just as the orbs spawn, which is only possible with certain post-adds reopener alignments.
* **Meteors Phase Hypercharge**

  * In the meteors phase, Hypercharging can grant you extra potency.

    * Depending on how your group kills meteors, you may be able to gain some extra potency through either Auto Crossbow casts or Ricochet AoE by using Hypercharge. ACB is only viable when hitting 3 targets, while the extra Ricochet charges will always be useful (as long as one meteor is alive). Meteors tend to die quickly, however, and if you’re baiting a far orb you may not have time to take full advantage of a meteors phase Hypercharge.

### Tactician

Many of the raid-wide attacks in E1S do a flat percentage of your HP as damage, which makes Tactician a bit less useful. With that said, using Tactician during adds phase is definitely helpful for healer DPS, mitigating cleave and raidwide damage.

## E2S

### Damage Optimization

This is a dummy encounter (no downtime or adds), and mechanics don’t screw with our rotation. So stick to the optimization basics outlined in [the Machinist guide](link).

### Tactician

There are a number of circumstances where Tactician can help save a GCD heal. The biggest offender is the Flare + stack sequence (first delayed flare mechanic). If you opt to mitigate this, you can also catch the Dark Fires into stack sequence earlier on (first delayed Dark Fires mechanic).

## E3S

### Damage Optimization

* **Early Air Anchor Opener**

  * Use Air Anchor within the first 4 GCDs.

    * Due to the timing of the first Maelstrom disconnect, using Air Anchor early in your opener will allow you to fit an extra cast before the boss jumps away.
* **Quick Drill After First Maelstrom**

  * Use Drill as your first GCD after the first Maelstrom.

    * You have exactly 3:01 to hit the boss between Maelstroms, meaning any delay on Drill after first Maelstrom will cost you a cast at 2.5 GCD. You will probably tend to do this anyway, but it bears an explicit statement. Never delay Drill under any circumstances between Maelstroms.
* **Flamethrower After Each Maelstrom**

  * Use flamethrower at least 2.5 sec before the boss becomes targetable.

    * If you can get into position quickly enough, channeling Flamethrower at the end of the each Maelstrom downtime can grant you a free 100 potency while you retarget the boss and hit your GCD. After the second Maelstrom, you will want to open with a Reassemble-Drill. Make sure to cast Reassemble before beginning your Flamethrower channel.
* **Skillspeed**

  * A GCD faster than 2.48 has numerous benefits on this fight.

    * Using the early Anchor opener, you may need a GCD faster than 2.48 to fit an Anchor in before second Maelstrom. This can vary a bit with instance speed, so keep an eye on it. Using Anchor as the first GCD in your opener can also help with this. At 2.38 GCD, you can close each pre-Maelstrom sequence on a Clean Shot, which is a huge potency gain over dropping the combo. Clean Shot is worth 670 potency, compared to the piddly 220 and 330 of the other combo actions.

### Tactician

You’ll want to cover as much of the post-Stormy Horizon damage as possible. Generally speaking, popping Tactician immediately after the side-to-side dodge will grant the most value. Using it here, you can also mitigate the first Tsunami cast, making the raid split mechanic easier for your healers to manage without healing GCDs.

## E4S

### Damage Optimization

* **Stock Ricochet Charges for First Healer Gaols**

  * Try to enter first gaols with 2 charges of Ricochet stocked.

    * Casting Ricochet on the gaol close to Titan will give you a free 75 AoE potency per cast.
* **Stock Heat for First Healer Gaols**

  * Save a Hypercharge for use during first gaols.

    * This will help you break the healers out more quickly, adding to raid DPS. Additionally, saving Hypercharge for gaols will grant you extra casts of Ricochet on the gaol nearest to Titan, yielding free AoE potency.
* **Manual Drop-Down After Uplift**

  * If you end up on an elevated platform during Uplift, manually drop down before the mechanic completes.

    * When the arena returns to its normal elevation, you will briefly be unable to cast, causing you to clip your GCD. By forcing yourself to be on a lower platform when the arena returns to normal, you can avoid this interruption. Make sure all markers have been properly resolved before doing this.
* **Queen Restrictions in Phase 2**

  * Try to avoid using Queen around Uplifts.

    * Due to shitty AI, Uplift can cause Queen to interrupt her attacks, or stop attacking completely. This is incompletely tested, but if you or your robot friend are ever knocked up onto an elevated section of the arena, you risk losing Queen attacks. Depending on when buffs go out, you may be forced to make some tricky decisions.
* **Flamethrower Before Phase 2 and 3**

  * Use flamethrower at least 2.5 sec before the boss becomes targetable.

    * Channeling Flamethrower during the downtimes before phase 2 and 3 begin can grant you a free 100 potency while you retarget the boss and hit your GCD. You may not want to do this at the start of phase 2, depending on the timing of buffs in your group. Getting off Queen and Reassemble at the proper timing is more important than the chance at this extra potency. That said, you will likely have sufficient time to cast Queen and Reassemble, start your Flamethrower, and still begin the phase at the correct time.

### Limit Break Optimization

There are a few common strategies for ranged LB usage in E4S. Most optimized groups will opt for a ranged LB3 on the second set of healer gaols, when the party is split by Uplift. Hitting 3 targets with ranged LB3 is a big gain over only hitting the boss with melee LB3. 

With this LB3 timing, holding Anchor until its usual spot in the phase 2 reopener could cost you a use at the end of the fight, as you will delay it during the LB3 animation. Using Air Anchor and Drill back-to-back to start the phase will allow you to put both on cooldown immediately before casting the LB3. Additionally, you will generally find yourself above 50 heat just prior to the Uplift associated with second healer gaols. Avoid using Hypercharge before casting LB3. The LB3 will generally leave the gaols with about 10% HP, giving you another opportunity to spend Ricochet charges for extra potency. This also happens to coincide with a cast of Brotherhood, if you have a MNK in your party.

Most of the tips in the previous section assumed you’ll be doing second gaols LB3, but you may want to LB the first set of gaols instead. It’s impossible to guarantee an LB3 here without some form of cheese, so you’ll usually be doing LB2, which has a much shorter animation lock than LB3. Because of this, most of the preparation issues discussed above don’t apply here. That said, using LB on first gaol set will impact your lead-up into the 6-min burst sequence. Ensure that you have enough heat (and your Drill and Anchor timings are correct) to execute your burst on time.

If your group does opt to cheese some extra LB for a ranged LB3 on first gaols, the longer animation may interact negatively with your rotation. This requires some additional testing.

Finally, anytime you use LB in any encounter, always make sure you finish your combo before using the ability. Additionally, LB can be "weaved" like an ogcd - you don't need to wait for your gcd to clear to start the cast.

### Tactician

There’s a lot of places in this fight where your healers might ask for mitigation, so be sure to communicate well. That said, your top priorities are the first Earthen Fury + Dirty in phase 3, and the two Voice of the Land + Tumult (in between) near the end of the fight. In phase 2, you can mitigate the first Tumult and the Earthen Fury that precedes it. However, your healers might also ask for it during one of the Uplift mechanics. Finally, in the first phase, mitigating the first set of orange stack markers is fine. However, your healers are more likely to save a GCD heal if you use Tactician just before the first car/hands mechanic. Mitigating Crumbling Down may also make sense, depending on your healer’s preferences.

# Eden’s Verse (E5S-E8S)

Last Updated: 28-Aug-2020

## E5S

### Early Wildfire

Use Wildfire after 4th GCD or sooner in the opener to finish it before the first Fury 14 knockback.

### Tactician

Cover any Judgement Volt AoEs you can, especially the one during Chain Lightning.

## E6S

### Wildfire raid buff desync

Transition to the last phase will desync some raid buffs from Wildfire but delaying to resync might cost Wildfire casts so keep using it on cooldown.

### Reassemble

It’s possible to get 2 casts of Reassemble during Ifrit+Garuda phase instead of delaying the second cast to the start of Raktapaksa. You’ll have to be quite aggressive with precasting it during transition, be quick with your first gcd and avoid any clipping to pull it off though. Reassemble should come back up in time for the last or second-to-last gcd in the phase so you can get the cast out if you delay the last Drill in the phase for it.

### Queen

Take care not to summon Queen just before phase transitions or a lot of the potency will be lost.

### Skill speed

2.44 gcd or faster can gain you a Drill cast just before phase transitions but be careful of ghosting since it’ll eat Reassemble as well.

### Tactician

Target Inferno Howls or other unavoidable AoE damage like Storm of Fury tethers + Air Bump.

## E7S

### Rotation alignments

This fight will throw a serious wrench into all your alignments with the downtime and teleports. Do your best to keep using Drill, Anchor and Wildfire on cooldown and avoiding heat waste. I do this at the expense of delaying Barrel Stabilizer but honestly, I don’t know the optimal answer to this. Just press buttons.

### Early Anchor

2nd or 3rd GCD Anchor will get you a cast before first teleport, but it’ll be delayed into the add phase either way so it doesn't get an extra cast per se.

### Queen

Don’t summon Queen during teleports as it’ll get disabled during the forced movement and miss punches and/or Bunker.

### Tactician

Empty waves, first teleport with tethers, Unearned Envy AoEs from Blasphemy in add phase, black and white portals if the party is stacking and eating the avoidable damage.

## E8S

### Phase 1 end

2.44 GCD or faster can get an extra Drill, Anchor or Clean Shot at the end of the first phase. With 2.50 GCD you can end the phase on a Clean Shot for a small potency gain by doing only 4 Heat Blasts in your last Hypercharge to gain the needed time to finish the combo.

### Add phase: Left/West side

Take the left side to silence one of the Earth add’s Stoneskin casts. Drill and Anchor are very good at dropping Electric adds. Queen can be used at lower gear levels for 2nd or 3rd wave to ease dealing with Earth and Aqua adds. Wildfire is not worth using as the adds die far too quickly and it won’t be ready for reopener.

Communicate with your party members to fine tune your plan for the phase and to make the most of everyone’s cooldowns and abilities, there are many correct ways to do the phase.

### Reopeners with potion

Since Shiva is instantly targetable after the add phase, you can’t use a precast potion without clipping, so the following structure is recommended:

1 (pot) > Drill (REA+Queen) > Anchor > 2 > 3 (WF+HC)

Drill and Anchor positions can be swapped if Queen was used in add phase and you need the battery earlier for the opener. Anchor can be delayed by 1 gcd after Drill but no later or Reassemble can’t be realigned with Drill for the next cast.

### Tactician

This fight requires heavy mitigation at times so communicate with your healers to find the pressure points. Good example targets:

* Absolute Zero (right at the start during opener)
* Light Rampant
* Akh Morn + Morn Afah (after adds during reopener)
* Double knockback mirrors
* Icelit Dragonsong
* Akh Morn + Morn Afah (at the end)

# Eden’s Promise Fight Guide for MCH

By Hinoka Shirasagi (Leviathan)

## Considerations for All Fights

Before changing any burst windows or mitigation plans, talk to your raid group about it first. Make sure you’re using Wildfire when the rest of the party is using their buffs and make sure you’re mitigating damage when your healers need you to. If you’re in PF and you can’t do that, do your best with what you’re given.

## e9s

### Clouds during Empty Plane:

There are a number of ways you can handle your cloud during Empty Plane. You can have Heat available when your cloud spawns and Drill comes up after it spawns. If you elect to use Drill on your cloud, be careful of overkill. If your cloud doesn’t have a lot of health left, use Drill on the boss and return to the cloud with your standard combo or Heat Blasts if you Hypercharge after the Drill.

### Wildfire and Potion Windows:

Be wary of your placement during Empty Plane as you may miss buffs if you are on the opposite side of the arena from the person using the buff. For faster kill times it may be prudent to hold buffs and Wildfire until after Empty Plane finishes so you can use it alongside your second potion. For slower kill times, use your potion with the 6 minute Wildfire that comes up during Brambles with Towers.

### Recommended Tactician Usage:

Obscure Woods, Deluge of Darkness, Empty Plane, and Ground-Razing Particle Beam are the raidwides, and they are all good choices for Tactician. If your group opts for a strat where you stack the first set of Brambles, you may want to hold the first Tactician to use it on Evil Seed. If your group has a fast kill time and you adopt the speed kill strat where you ignore the clouds during Empty Plane, use Tactician on Deluge of Darkness. 

## e10s

### Wildfire and Potion Windows:

There is 0 reason to hold 2 minutes in this fight, so you will be using Wildfire on cooldown alongside buffs. Use your second potion with the 6 minute buff window. If you are pushing against enrage, you may want to use it sooner than the 6 minute buff window to gain a third use at the very end.

### Recommended Tactician Usage:

Tactician is best used to mitigate the Umbral Orbs mechanic. Addle and Reprisal will not work on Umbral Orbs, only shields or buff mitigations like Tactician will. Deepshadow Nova, Darkness Unleashed, and Blighting Burst are the raidwides you want to mitigate otherwise. If your group opts to do uptime Spinny Dogs, you will need to make sure Tactician is up for that. You can mitigate the Blighting Burst stacks and it will be up in time for Spinny Dogs and subsequent Umbral Orbs.

## e11s

### Wildfire and Potion Windows:

If you have a faster kill time, I strongly recommend moving your parties’ 4 minute buff window to 4:30 so that the raid’s burst is also under the second potion. The intermissions in this fight where the boss is untargetable line up perfectly with this, with your next Wildfire coming off cooldown right as the boss is targetable after the second intermission. If you don’t delay the buff window with a fast kill time, you will still want to use your second potion on cooldown at 4:30 to ensure you get 3 uses out of the fight. Your final burst window will be with a potion after Prismatic Deception. If your kill time is slower and you are hitting enrage, you will use your second potion at the 6:30 buff window and your final one at the 11 minute buff window.

### Recommended Tactician Usage:

Electric flavor Elemental Break hurts a lot with the AoEs that everyone gets, as well as Light flavor Elemental Break’s line stacks. Burnished Glory and the DoT it applies also hurt a ton. Ask your healers which they prefer you mitigate, but Electric Elemental Break is always a safe choice. Definitely use Tactician for the Electric cycle at the end.

## e12s Door

### Wildfire and Potion Windows:

I would not recommend holding buffs during Shiva Junction, your group should try to burst during the mechanic. In the PoVs section of this guide you can find PoVs for examples of how you should handle this phase. Use your second potion with the Wildfire that comes up during Lions, and for faster kill times, ask your group to hold buffs until after Lions. If you are hitting enrage, you might want to use an opener with an earlier Wildfire to get the full damage out of the final one.

### Recommended Tactician Usage:

Maleficium is always a nice target, but the knockback and icicles during Shiva Junction hit very hard and may need extra mitigation in the form of Tactician. You can use Tactician in your opener before Wildfire for the first Obliterate and it will be up for Shiva Junction if your healers want it there for the knockback and Pillar Pierce. The statue stacks before the lasers also hurt a ton, and should be mitigated if Tactician is up.

## e12s Oracle

### Wildfire and Potion Windows:

Hold your 2 minute Wildfire for after Basic Relativity resolves. There won’t be enough time before the stun for your party to get the full buff window and finish their burst. Automaton Queen will stop attacking while you are stunned, so you should either use it as your gauge hits 50 battery during Basic Relativity so that you get a 50 battery Queen during the buff window or hold onto it until after the stun for a 100 battery Queen during the buff window. Your next burst window will be right after Intermediate Relativity resolves. Use your second potion with the Wildfire and burst window after Advanced Relativity. 

### Recommended Tactician Usage:

I personally recommend using Tactician on each of the Relativity casts. All of them are nearly 2 minutes apart, allowing you to mitigate every one of them, and they are by far the hardest hitting raidwides in this fight. If your healers don’t want it there, your next best options will be Shockwave Pulsar casts and the Shell Crusher/Spirit Taker stack then spread.

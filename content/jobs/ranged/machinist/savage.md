## E1S

### Damage Optimization

* **Stock Ricochet Charges for Adds Phase**

  * Try to enter adds phase with 2 charges of Ricochet stocked.

    * On 2 targets, Ricochet yields an additional 75 AoE potency per cast, for 150 free potency from stocked charges. Keep in mind that, depending on your opener, Ricochet’s natural cooldown may turn over during the pre-adds downtime.
* **Stock Heat for Adds Phase**

  * Try to enter adds phase with 85-100 heat.

    * By avoiding a Hypercharge following the 2-min burst period, you should be able to enter adds phase with capped or nearly capped heat. Stocking and blowing heat during the adds phase will grant a lot of extra potency (up to 75 x 5 = 375). You have to overcap heat by more than 20 for this to stop being a gain - so don’t sweat overcapping a bit if it occurs.
* **Adds Phase Bioblaster**

  * In the adds phase, replace your first cast of Drill with Bioblaster.

    * On 2 targets, full duration Bioblaster is a 20 potency gain over Drill. Due to the duration of the phase, you are unlikely to get full DoT ticks twice, so use Drill normally when it comes back up.
* **Adds Phase Spread Shot**

  * In the adds phase, replace the 1-2-3 combo with Spread Shot when you know you will not reach Clean Shot before the phase ends.

    * On 2 targets, the heated combo is only a gain over Spread Shot when an entire 1-2-3 combo replaces 3 Spread Shots. Look at the expected duration of your adds phase. An Anchor, a Bioblaster, two Hypercharges, and a Drill take 22.5 sec. Optimized groups will kill the adds in approximately 25 sec, leaving you time for one or two additional GCDs. This means that you will be unable to finish your combo, making Spread Shot a gain of 140 or 170 potency, depending on whether you replaced 1 or 2 combo GCDs.
* **Avoid Queen in Adds Phase**

  * Save your Battery for after the cutscene.

    * Because the optimal adds phase generates only 20 battery, summoning Queen will prevent you from using her on the post-cutscene reopener sequence, which typically contains most/all of your group’s buffs.
* **Flamethrower After Cutscene**

  * Use flamethrower at least 2.5 sec before the boss becomes targetable.

    * It takes a moment to retarget the boss and hit a button. We can potentially take advantage of this time to get a lucky tick of Flamethrower. Under no circumstances should you delay getting into your normal rotation when the boss is back - this is just a passive channel (pointed at the boss) that may grant you 100 potency if your timing is good. This technique is useful after downtime in many circumstances, as described later in this guide. If you plan to use Reassemble on your first GCD after downtime, you can cast it before flamethrower without fear of losing the buff. You don’t want to do this at the start of adds phase, as you will get murdered by the proximity AoEs.
* **Stock Ricochet Charges for Meteors Phase**

  * Try to enter meteors phase with 2 charges of Ricochet stocked.

    * Each cast of Ricochet on a meteor will also hit the boss, for a total of 75 x 2 = 150 free potency.
* **Meteors Phase Spread Shot**

  * In the meteors phase, you can replace combo GCDs with Spread Shots.

    * With proper positioning, you can hit 3 targets with Spread Shot (boss + 2 meteors), making this a gain of 135 potency per GCD over the 1-2-3 combo. If you are on far orb baiting duty, you will only have time for 1-2 Spread Shots before you need to be in your bait position. Spread Shot breaks your combo, so only do this after finishing with Clean Shot.
* **Meteors Phase Bioblaster**

  * In the meteors phase, you can replace a cast of Drill with Bioblaster.

    * This is a bit risky, so look at how your group tends to kill the meteors before trying this. Hitting 3 targets with Bioblaster, you need 11 total ticks for this to be a gain over Drill. If we assume you’ll get the full 6 ticks on the boss, you’ll need 5 ticks between the two orbs. You will reach this point between 7 and 9 seconds after applying Bioblaster, depending on server tick timing. This is near typical orb lifespan, so apply with care. This is best applied if Bioblaster comes up just as the orbs spawn, which is only possible with certain post-adds reopener alignments.
* **Meteors Phase Hypercharge**

  * In the meteors phase, Hypercharging can grant you extra potency.

    * Depending on how your group kills meteors, you may be able to gain some extra potency through either Auto Crossbow casts or Ricochet AoE by using Hypercharge. ACB is only viable when hitting 3 targets, while the extra Ricochet charges will always be useful (as long as one meteor is alive). Meteors tend to die quickly, however, and if you’re baiting a far orb you may not have time to take full advantage of a meteors phase Hypercharge.

### Tactician

Many of the raid-wide attacks in E1S do a flat percentage of your HP as damage, which makes Tactician a bit less useful. With that said, using Tactician during adds phase is definitely helpful for healer DPS, mitigating cleave and raidwide damage.

## E2S

### Damage Optimization

This is a dummy encounter (no downtime or adds), and mechanics don’t screw with our rotation. So stick to the optimization basics outlined in [the Machinist guide](link).

### Tactician

There are a number of circumstances where Tactician can help save a GCD heal. The biggest offender is the Flare + stack sequence (first delayed flare mechanic). If you opt to mitigate this, you can also catch the Dark Fires into stack sequence earlier on (first delayed Dark Fires mechanic).

## E3S

### Damage Optimization

* **Early Air Anchor Opener**

  * Use Air Anchor within the first 4 GCDs.

    * Due to the timing of the first Maelstrom disconnect, using Air Anchor early in your opener will allow you to fit an extra cast before the boss jumps away.
* **Quick Drill After First Maelstrom**

  * Use Drill as your first GCD after the first Maelstrom.

    * You have exactly 3:01 to hit the boss between Maelstroms, meaning any delay on Drill after first Maelstrom will cost you a cast at 2.5 GCD. You will probably tend to do this anyway, but it bears an explicit statement. Never delay Drill under any circumstances between Maelstroms.
* **Flamethrower After Each Maelstrom**

  * Use flamethrower at least 2.5 sec before the boss becomes targetable.

    * If you can get into position quickly enough, channeling Flamethrower at the end of the each Maelstrom downtime can grant you a free 100 potency while you retarget the boss and hit your GCD. After the second Maelstrom, you will want to open with a Reassemble-Drill. Make sure to cast Reassemble before beginning your Flamethrower channel.
* **Skillspeed**

  * A GCD faster than 2.48 has numerous benefits on this fight.

    * Using the early Anchor opener, you may need a GCD faster than 2.48 to fit an Anchor in before second Maelstrom. This can vary a bit with instance speed, so keep an eye on it. Using Anchor as the first GCD in your opener can also help with this. At 2.38 GCD, you can close each pre-Maelstrom sequence on a Clean Shot, which is a huge potency gain over dropping the combo. Clean Shot is worth 670 potency, compared to the piddly 220 and 330 of the other combo actions.

### Tactician

You’ll want to cover as much of the post-Stormy Horizon damage as possible. Generally speaking, popping Tactician immediately after the side-to-side dodge will grant the most value. Using it here, you can also mitigate the first Tsunami cast, making the raid split mechanic easier for your healers to manage without healing GCDs.

## E4S

### Damage Optimization

* **Stock Ricochet Charges for First Healer Gaols**

  * Try to enter first gaols with 2 charges of Ricochet stocked.

    * Casting Ricochet on the gaol close to Titan will give you a free 75 AoE potency per cast.
* **Stock Heat for First Healer Gaols**

  * Save a Hypercharge for use during first gaols.

    * This will help you break the healers out more quickly, adding to raid DPS. Additionally, saving Hypercharge for gaols will grant you extra casts of Ricochet on the gaol nearest to Titan, yielding free AoE potency.
* **Manual Drop-Down After Uplift**

  * If you end up on an elevated platform during Uplift, manually drop down before the mechanic completes.

    * When the arena returns to its normal elevation, you will briefly be unable to cast, causing you to clip your GCD. By forcing yourself to be on a lower platform when the arena returns to normal, you can avoid this interruption. Make sure all markers have been properly resolved before doing this.
* **Queen Restrictions in Phase 2**

  * Try to avoid using Queen around Uplifts.

    * Due to shitty AI, Uplift can cause Queen to interrupt her attacks, or stop attacking completely. This is incompletely tested, but if you or your robot friend are ever knocked up onto an elevated section of the arena, you risk losing Queen attacks. Depending on when buffs go out, you may be forced to make some tricky decisions.
* **Flamethrower Before Phase 2 and 3**

  * Use flamethrower at least 2.5 sec before the boss becomes targetable.

    * Channeling Flamethrower during the downtimes before phase 2 and 3 begin can grant you a free 100 potency while you retarget the boss and hit your GCD. You may not want to do this at the start of phase 2, depending on the timing of buffs in your group. Getting off Queen and Reassemble at the proper timing is more important than the chance at this extra potency. That said, you will likely have sufficient time to cast Queen and Reassemble, start your Flamethrower, and still begin the phase at the correct time.

### Limit Break Optimization

There are a few common strategies for ranged LB usage in E4S. Most optimized groups will opt for a ranged LB3 on the second set of healer gaols, when the party is split by Uplift. Hitting 3 targets with ranged LB3 is a big gain over only hitting the boss with melee LB3. 

With this LB3 timing, holding Anchor until its usual spot in the phase 2 reopener could cost you a use at the end of the fight, as you will delay it during the LB3 animation. Using Air Anchor and Drill back-to-back to start the phase will allow you to put both on cooldown immediately before casting the LB3. Additionally, you will generally find yourself above 50 heat just prior to the Uplift associated with second healer gaols. Avoid using Hypercharge before casting LB3. The LB3 will generally leave the gaols with about 10% HP, giving you another opportunity to spend Ricochet charges for extra potency. This also happens to coincide with a cast of Brotherhood, if you have a MNK in your party.

Most of the tips in the previous section assumed you’ll be doing second gaols LB3, but you may want to LB the first set of gaols instead. It’s impossible to guarantee an LB3 here without some form of cheese, so you’ll usually be doing LB2, which has a much shorter animation lock than LB3. Because of this, most of the preparation issues discussed above don’t apply here. That said, using LB on first gaol set will impact your lead-up into the 6-min burst sequence. Ensure that you have enough heat (and your Drill and Anchor timings are correct) to execute your burst on time.

If your group does opt to cheese some extra LB for a ranged LB3 on first gaols, the longer animation may interact negatively with your rotation. This requires some additional testing.

Finally, anytime you use LB in any encounter, always make sure you finish your combo before using the ability. Additionally, LB can be "weaved" like an ogcd - you don't need to wait for your gcd to clear to start the cast.

### Tactician

There’s a lot of places in this fight where your healers might ask for mitigation, so be sure to communicate well. That said, your top priorities are the first Earthen Fury + Dirty in phase 3, and the two Voice of the Land + Tumult (in between) near the end of the fight. In phase 2, you can mitigate the first Tumult and the Earthen Fury that precedes it. However, your healers might also ask for it during one of the Uplift mechanics. Finally, in the first phase, mitigating the first set of orange stack markers is fine. However, your healers are more likely to save a GCD heal if you use Tactician just before the first car/hands mechanic. Mitigating Crumbling Down may also make sense, depending on your healer’s preferences.

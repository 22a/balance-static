## Introduction

The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate) is the only ultimate released in FFXIV: Shadowbringers. The encounter is split into four phases: Living Liquid, Brute Justice/Cruise Chaser, Alexander Prime, and Perfect Alexander. The fight in its entirety is 18 minutes long. 

This guide will go over the rotational structure and basic guidelines for Machinist for the entire encounter. Full disclaimer, there are MANY strats for this fight. I won’t be covering all of them. Adjust as needed for your specific group. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of the class and its rotational structure

Edit: The 2.44 set was removed due to the 535 relic making the 2.5 set superior by a wide margin.

## Phase 1: Living Liquid

Machinist suffers the most in this phase compared to the other physical ranged jobs due to a lack of AoE skills. There’s not much you can do to hit both Living Liquid and Liquid Hand at the same time. Since most of your damage will be single target, it’s important to keep an eye on the health of both Living Liquid and the Hand and even out DPS where appropriate.

### Drill, Bioblaster and You

Bioblaster should be used as long as both bosses are together and Reassemble is unavailable. The potency difference between drill and bioblaster is small (a mere 20 potency), but a reassembled drill is ~1300 potency and has priority over any other GCD at two targets. As a side note: Flamethrower is generally *not* worth using outside of tick fishing.\
\
*(Falling under the category of optimization; with earlier kill times (In the realm of ~2:00 - 2:10),  you can get away with using Flamethrower to replace anywhere from two to three GCDs in Living Liquid during the Drainage tank buster. It comes at the loss of 10 - 15 heat, but it would allow you to use Barrel Stabilizer on cooldown, not overcap, and enter phase 2 with max or near max heat gauge. The gain from this is roughly 200 potency. Ensure you don’t drift Drill or Air Anchor to do this.)*

The first phase of TEA hard enrages at 2:20. Because of this length specifically, groups will hold their 2-minute buff windows for phase 2. What does this mean for us? Any Wildfire timing will work and should be decided based on group composition. However, it does mean you should always start with Reassemble prepull. Waiting for 0:20 to use Reassemble most likely will result in a lost cast. 

There are different variations on how to sequence your opener depending on your comp. In a buff-heavy comp, I suggest doing the standard opener, as it will out-damage any other variance due to the timing of how bosses spawn. When following a standard structure, the second Drill/Bio window should always be a Drill. The hand spawns at this point, but it’s hit or miss on whether Bioblaster will land on both targets. Alternatively, in comps lacking buffs, a set up of Reassemble Air Anchor > Drill will guarantee Bioblaster hits both bosses at the 20 second mark. Additionally, starting with Air Anchor will allow you to get a final usage in the phase with kill times around 2:00.

Here's a look at how Drill and Bioblaster interact with Chain Stratagem and Trick Attack. Since both of these buffs only affect half of the Bioblaster hit, it’s important to note the damage difference when you're planning out using Drill or Bioblaster. For reference, expected values were calculated with the base crit stat from the BiS in mind.

|                                           |         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Base Drill Potency                        | 700     |
| Base Bioblaster Potency                   | 720     |
| Expected Drill Potency                    | 790     |
| Expected Bioblaster Potency               | 818     |
| Expected Drill under Trick                | 830     |
| Expected Bioblaster under Trick           | 859     |
| Expected Drill under Chain                | 831     |
| Expected Bioblaster under Chain           | 839     |
| Expected Drill under Trick and Chain      | **872** |
| Expected Bioblaster under Trick and Chain | 860     |



Basically, what this means is Bioblaster is better unless you have both Chain and Trick or you’re using Reassemble. Using this chart and thinking of a 2-minute rotation cycle with both of these buffs in only Drills the rotation would be as follows:  

1st: Reassemble Drill\
2nd: Drill\
3rd: Bioblaster\
4th: Reassemble Drill\
5th: Bioblaster\
6th: Bioblaster  

For the sake of this fight in particular, you may not want to follow that specific rotation. The third use, which normally would be a Bioblaster, comes up during Jagd Dolls. Unless your group is dragging one of the bosses towards your section of the arena it would be more beneficial to use Drill here instead on the Doll. Adjust accordingly to the strat your raid group is using.

### Queen & Jagd Dolls

It is heavily suggested not to use Automaton Queen while Jagd Dolls are out. Her targeting A.I. is wonky and unreliable. Having her target an ally’s Jagd Doll will probably result in a wipe and also gives you much less control over the damage output on your own with her damage variance. It’s also highly suggested to not use Drill or Air Anchor if a Doll has below 40% HP. At that point, a poorly timed direct critical hit will kill your add. It’s much safer to use the GCD on Living Liquid and come back to your Doll with a heated shot if that’s what happens.

The rest of the fight’s rotation is going to be somewhat normal aside from usage of Bioblaster instead of Drill. During prog you will want to check the health of both bosses to ensure they’re staying close enough to satisfy the requirements of Hand of Pain.

With Living Liquid being such a short phase, it’s going to require some odd Queen summons. This may change slightly due to kill times, but if extending the phase to enrage, the first summon should be at 80 gauge while the second summon will be at 50. This allows us to build our battery back up before the phase ends to prepare for a big buff window in Phase 2. If you’re killing around the 2-minute mark, you may only want to summon Queen once around 60 seconds. Otherwise you’ll risk going into BJ/CC with less than 50 battery.

Kill times will vary, but the goal for Living Liquid is to end with 70 - 85 Heat (along with an unused Barrel Stabilizer) and 60 - 80 Battery. This enables your reopener on Phase 2 to be as high as possible without overcapping.\
\
*Keep in mind that once your group is comfortable with the DPS check at the end of Phase 1, you can then extend to the enrage cast by killing Liquid Hand first. This is a great strat for party comps with 3-minute burst windows,  as it’ll allow them to do a full opener along with the 2-minute burst window upon the start of Phase 2.*

#### Suggested uses for Tactician:

* As tank tethers appear. Covers Splashes, tank busters, and Cascade
* Jagd Doll sacrifices 

## Phase 2: Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser

Physical ranged really shine in this phase. They’re capable of handling all of the various movement mechanics without losing uptime. Machinists in particular can line up really well for the burst needed to take down the [Plasma Shield](#plasma-shield) on Cruise Chaser. I will focus on the rotation aspect since regardless of strat, your rotation should remain the same.

### Re-Opening With Delayed Reassemble

Backtracking to what we discussed with [Living Liquid](#living-liquid), you should be entering Phase 2 with a substantial amount of Heat and Battery. Given the amount of downtime between Phase 1 and 2 with Limit Cut, your Wildfire structure will reset. If you opened with a 4th GCD Wildfire, you can opt for a different opener here without any drawbacks given you still fit it into raid buffs. Due to the fact Reassemble is on a 55 second timer, we have some wiggle room on where we place it in our reopener. Using the example below, Reassemble will come back up for our Drill 60 seconds into Phase 2 when the Hidden Mines are being dropped and Enumeration stacks occur. 

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/888378770724093972/unknown.png)
Drill > Gauss Round > Ricochet > Split Shot > Reassemble > Queen > Air Anchor > Gauss Round > Ricochet > Slug Shot > Gauss Round > Ricochet > Clean Shot  > Hypercharge > Heat Blast > Wildfire> Heat Blast > Barrel Stabilizer > etc.

Bioblaster rules apply the same as they did in Phase 1. Some strats have the bosses tanked within close proximity of each other, so take advantage of this as much as possible. 

### Plasma Shield

If your main target is Cruise Chaser, avoid using Automaton Queen when the Plasma Shield is being applied. Queen will NOT target the shield. Instead, she’ll target Cruise Chaser and hit for a bunch of zeroes. Best practice is to hold Queen until the shield has been destroyed, or use her extremely early for this reason. During prog, you can delay your drill by a GCD or two in preparation for Plasma Shield. Once the group is more comfortable, this won’t be necessary.

### To Blast or Not to Blast

At the 5-minute mark in the encounter, your group will have two options. Either: 

1. Unload on Brute Justice and Cruise in another burst window 
2. Hold that burst window for the first damage phase in Phase 3. 

If dps is on the lower side, especially in prog, it’s suggested blowing your raid buffs and burst cooldowns at five minutes. This happens at the same time that Nisi resolves so everyone will be in proximity of raid buffs regardless of strat used. Keep in mind, regardless of whether or not you use your burst at five minutes that you will still get two WF windows in Phase 3. Choosing whether or not to use them at the end of Phase 2 should be a group decision discussed in your raid group but is mostly dependent on group DPS before Nisi resolves.

As with Living Liquid, it’s suggested ending Phase 2 with a considerable amount of Heat and Battery for the burst going into Alexander Prime.

#### Suggested uses for Tactician in Brute Justice/Cruise Chaser:

* Second water stack, will also catch the Hidden Mines
* Double Whirlwind

## Phase 3: Alexander Prime

Alexander Prime is when Machinist really starts to set itself apart from its physical ranged counterparts. Unlike the first two phases, the rest of the fight is almost entirely single target bosses. These last two phases have a ton of downtime, which is great for us. All of our heavy hitting cooldowns (aside from Wildfire) will be up every single time Alex is targetable.

This is where pots start to matter. You can either pot in the first mini damage phase of Alexander or the second and they’ll still be back up for Phase 4. The timings for pots is reliant on if you used Wildfire at the end of Phase 2 or not. If you decide to pot in the first mini damage phase, you can actually pot before the Time Stop. This mechanic freezes everything cooldown-related, including pot timers. If you time it correctly, you’ll be able to skip the pot animation lock and have a full timer to unload all of your stored up Heat and Battery.

### Taking Advantage of The Heart

The main exploit for Machinist in this phase is during the crystal drops/heart phase. Even though the heart doesn’t take damage once it turns gold, you will still gain Gauge from attacking it. Make sure you get off Air Anchor and as many GCDs as you can during the heart phase since it's free damage! Air Anchor will come back up for the next damage phase no matter where you use it.\
\
*It’s highly dangerous due to the proximity explosions, but it is possible for 100% uptime during heart phase. The theoretical max gain from hitting the heart is 50 Battery and 45 Heat using Air Anchor and three full combos. This strategy is not suggested while learning the phase. Here’s two clips showing how it’s done: 50 Battery Inception*

### Burn Phase

During adds, be careful about the timing for when you summon Queen. If summoned too early, it’s possible she’ll target Alexander Prime whom is invulnerable until both Cruise Chaser and Brute Justice are dead. Once Brute Justice is down for the count, your main goal will be getting back up to max or near-max gauge for Perfect Alexander. Machinist is by far the best physical ranged option for Perfect phase, due to the fact that we can transition to Phase 4 of the fight with a 100/100 gauge.

#### Suggested uses for Tactician in Alexander Prime:

* Crystal explosions during Inception
* Incinerating Heat stack post-wormhole
* Sixth cast of J-Wave

## Phase 4: Perfect Alexander

Your reopener is going to be extremely busy. There’s no prepull to prep a pot or Reassemble, thus forcing you to weave in abilities you wouldn’t normally weave in an opener. You should also be capped on resources, meaning you will overcap on something. Choosing what you overcap is really the only option here if you’re going into the phase with full gauge.

### Stillness and Motion

Luckily for us, our opening burst is just short enough to cram everything into a 20-second period of time before Stillness/Motion. Even if you’re unlucky with Stillness first the following rotation can be done without being interrupted:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/888379620787884082/unknown.png)
Drill > Pot > Split Shot > Reassemble > Queen > Air Anchor > Gauss Round > Ricochet > Slug Shot > Wildfire > Hypercharge > Heat Blast > Ricochet > Heat Blast > Gauss Round > Heat Blast > Ricochet > Heat Blast > Gauss Round > Heat Blast > Ricochet > Clean Shot > Drill > Gauss Round > Ricochet 

Your final Drill should land right after Ordained Stillness goes off. With that being said, this opener is best utilized with Motion first. There’s a Barrel Stabilizer that needs to be used as well, but I suggest using it after the Forced March. It won’t cost you a cast over the course of the phase and holding it ensures you won’t overcap on Heat.

Alternatively, if you’re not attempting to unload everything in short buff windows this rotation can be done while still keeping Wildfire before stillness, but the second cast of Drill will be slightly delayed. This won’t result in any lost casts. While it loses some potency inside certain buffs it has the added benefit of getting your first Drill inside the pot: 

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/888379661405552670/unknown.png)
Queen > Split Shot > Pot > Drill > Gauss Round > Reassemble > Air Anchor > Ricochet > Gauss Round > Slug Shot > Wildfire > Hypercharge > Heat Blast > Ricochet > Heat Blast > Gauss Round > Heat Blast >  Ricochet > Heat Blast > Gauss Round > Heat Blast > Ricochet > Clean Shot > Split Shot > Drill

### Perfect Alignment

Queen usage in this phase lines up mostly with normal usage. The main thing to remember is Queen does stop when you get jailed. Each jail takes five seconds to come down, so pop her when there’s three or four jails left before your own, depending on battery gauge.

Phase 4 lasts exactly six minutes. This means we’re capable of using Wildfire three times and pots twice. Due to the pot alignment and syncing up with buffs, it’s suggested you hold your third Wildfire and second pot for either 4:30 or 5:00 (depending on your party comp). This usage should be discussed with your party.

Following a standard rotation at 2.5, it’s possible you’ll enter Fate Calibration Beta with your last GCD being a Slug Shot, unable to get the Clean Shot off. To remedy this, you’ll want to use a four Heat Blast Hypercharge to get your heated combo GCD rolling sooner. It will make your Drill and Air Anchor alignment a bit wonky doing this, but it's fine to delay both slightly into the next GCD. You won’t risk losing any casts by doing so and you’ll gain the potency of a Clean Shot plus the accompanying 10 Battery.

### Temporal Prisons

Machinist is fine to go into the fifth prison. Fifth Prison lands around the 5:30 mark, which is after our entire burst phase has ended and allows us to dispose of all built up Gauge beforehand. Ultimately it will depend on the other jobs in your party and personal DPS.

#### Suggested uses for Tactician in Perfect Alexander:

This phase length is six minutes, but due to downtime and the final enrage sequence, there’s only really a chance at using Tactician twice.

* Optical Sights
* Ordained Capital Punishment
* Irresistible Grace

# The Weapon’s Refrain (Ultimate)

By Dook Prime (Dook#0001)
(Patch 5.5)

## Introduction

The Weapon’s Refrain is the second ultimate released in FFXIV: Stormblood. The fight syncs you down to level 70 in an attempt to keep the difficulty of the fight equal to what it was on release. While it doesn’t do a great job of that, it does remove certain skills and abilities that we gained in Shadowbringers. The encounter is split into 5 phases; Garuda, Ifrit, Titan, Lahabrea, and Ultima. The fight in its entirety is 16 minutes long. This guide assumes a basic understanding of how Machinist works while outlining specific optimization due to phasing and AoE situations. **This doc is written with the 5.5 relic weapon in mind. If you’ve allotted your attribute points correctly on the weapon you’ll be at 2.46 GCD. This is important to keep in mind as some of the rotational decisions discussed here rely on that GCD speed.**

### Gearing Advice

With so many gearing options and different phase pushes, true BiS does not exist. The most important thing that will affect your DPS is ensuring you’ve got the Shadowbringers 535 relic. This weapon allows you to maximize your stats with a load out of Relic substat with 318 CRIT/318 DH/318 DET/228 SKSP. Every other piece of gear should be at a minimum of i470 to ensure it syncs down to max stats. Current food as of 5.5 is Smoked Chicken, and there’s the consideration to take here where you’ll want synced 1790 DET to max out food gains.

## Level 70 Considerations

There are three differences at level 70 that should be thought about when figuring out how to maximize potency gains. 

* Hot Shot: 300 potency compared to Air Anchor, which is normally 700 potency. The main thing to consider is that buff alignment matters very little (if anything, it’s better to use it outside of buffs) for Hot Shot. With only 300 potency, it now does less damage than Slug Shot. Expected potency is 460 when you include the Battery gain though, so it’s still worth using, and should be used as many times as possible.
* Rook Autoturret: 100 Battery is now 800 potency, and there’s no wind up animation on summon. Rook should still be used within buff windows, but you no longer want to use it before buffs come up. At 100 battery, Rook will attack for exactly 15s from pressing the button, to give you an idea of when you would need to summon it to get Rook Overdrive in buffs.
* Gauss Round and Ricochet no longer have three charges -- they’ve been reduced to two. It is much harder to avoid overcapping your charges inside of hypercharge, and this also limits which openers you can use. 3rd, 4th and 5th GCD openers all work at 70. The General Purpose opener (6th GCD) will force a huge overcap on Gauss and Rico. If you go into Hypercharge at zero stacks on both, but the cooldown on Gauss or Ricochet is seven seconds or less, it will overcap by the end of the ability’s usage even with weaving between every Heat Blast. Sometimes this may be unavoidable and it’s just something you would need to deal with. It’s a minimal loss (if any), but it’s mentioned to let you know it may not be a mistake on your end. Job is just jank.

## Phase 1: Garuda

Garuda is a very short phase. You’ll only get a single use of Wildfire in this phase, so there’s no need to worry about opener alignment. There’s two options for the first set of plumes-- Either use Flamethrower for approximately two GCDs (five seconds) or you can delay your opener and, instead of using Heat Blast, use Auto Crossbow for a portion of the Hypercharge window. The decision should be made on a group-by-group basis. The Plumes do not have a ton of health, so killing the spiny early will result in the tank only having one friction stack and make waking Garuda tighter than normal.

Specific to the 2.46 GCD we spoke of earlier, you may notice that Garuda jumps at an awkward time after the first set of cleanses go off. I handled this by using a four Heat Blast Hypercharge into Clean Shot. I ran into the issue where if I wasn’t using Hypercharge before the jump, I would be forced to delay Drill/Hot Shot, or I would overcap heat. Doing this avoided that problem and also ended my combo before the jump, so I didn’t need to worry about it dropping with a ton of gauge to spend. Faster GCD speeds can either hold Hypercharge for post-jump or use a full five Heat Blasts and still get the clean shot off, at the cost of using a skill speed accessory or dropping more skill speed into their relic at the cost of another substat. 

The second set of plumes lines up perfectly with a Reassemble, which can either be used on Auto Crossbow (If you’ve saved the required heat) or on Spread Shot into another use of Flamethrower. Both are 180 potency, so the choice should be made purely on how much you’re able to burst on the plumes and/or forced to hold DPS on Garuda, since killing her before tethers go off results in not waking. If using the aforementioned alignment in the previous paragraph, you’ll be able to finish off your Heated combo and lead directly into Spread Shot for the Plumes and not need to worry about dropping combo. Hot Shot and Drill both come off cooldown as this mechanic is ending, so you should do your best to ensure you get both off before she jumps. There’s slightly under 15 seconds of downtime between Garuda disappearing and Ifrit becoming targetable. A well-timed Heated Shot can be carried into the next phase.

## Phase 2: Ifrit

As with Garuda, Ifrit is a very short phase. You’ll only be able to get off a single Wildfire here. Your reopener is a good place to pot if your group is trying to make Ifrit dash skip consistent. 

Machinist should be one of the two people baiting eruptions. With how heat lines up around nails, you’ll be able to get a Hypercharge window out and possibly pad a bit during this mechanic. It’s completely dependent on comp and which jobs are actively hitting the two nails closer together. At minimum, it’s suggested to unload a single target Hypercharge into Ifrit and enjoy the free cleave from Ricochet on three targets. There’s a Drill (and possibly a Reassemble, depending on push timings) that comes up during nails that can be used on the nail you’re responsible for to make quick work of it without requiring the Hypercharge to do so.

## Phase 3: Titan

Whether you your group skips dashes or not will change whether or not you’ll manage to get two Wildfire windows. If your group is seeing dashes, plan on using Wildfire immediately for your reopener and again during Mario Kart at the end of the phase. If your group is skipping dashes, you’ll Wildfire after Gaols during the Tumult spam. 

For prog purposes, it’s wise to hold Drill for the healer Gaol. Especially early on, some people in the party may have weakness, and nobody wants to wipe to such an easy damage check. Machinist excels in short burst, it’s best to take full advantage of this until everyone is comfortable with the phase. 

Your last Barrel Stabilizer should happen either right before or right after Mario Kart. Ideally, you don’t want full gauge coming out of Titan because of the Magitek Bits and Lahabrea himself in the transition, so planning out a last use of Rook and possibly a final Hypercharge before Titan dies may be a benefit to you to avoid overcapping.

## Phase 4: Lahabrea

There’s not much for us to do here except build up some gauge. This phase lasts approximately 95 seconds (Time from Titan jumping to Ultima becoming targetable), so it’s something to keep in mind for Barrel Stabilizer usage and a possible late Wildfire in Titan.

You’ll be able to get at least three GCDs on the Magitek Bits before caster limit break kills them, so it’s wise to get a full Heated Combo on them and leave Hot Shot for Lahabrea, who sticks around for approximately five GCDs.

## Phase 5: Ultima

Ultima is targetable before Predation for about 28 seconds. Perfect for a Dex pot and a reopener. At 2.46, you can get two Hypercharge windows in and still end on Clean Shot but you’ll need to cut the second Hypercharge short by a single Heat Blast and finish the uptime with Drill and Clean Shot. You’ll need to drift Drill a bit for this, but it’s fine as the next bit of downtime during Predation is longer than 20 seconds.

Your next Wildfire window comes up during Annihilation, and can be a bit tricky to get off properly. Due to downtime, Drill and Wildfire butt heads a bit here, but the priority should be Wildfire. Holding Wildfire here can be detrimental as Ultima will disappear momentarily prior to Active Phase 2, and will cut into your Wildfire if it’s delayed slightly. Delaying Drill for Wildfire won’t lose you a usage prior to Suppression.

Your second pot and third Wildfire should come back up in Primal Roulette. Burst timings should be coordinated with your group for this portion of the fight. This Wildfire can be held for as long as it needs to for your party’s buff windows, since you won’t get another in the encounter.

## Suggested Tactician Usage

Uses of Tactician should always be discussed with your group. The list below is merely suggestions and your group may decide, based on their party composition or healing plan, that Tactician being used elsewhere is more beneficial.

* Garuda: 

  * During Cleanses (Possible to cover both Frictions and the cleanses that happen after them)
* Ifrit

  * Nails into Hellfire. If you use it during nails, try to inch towards the Searing Wind healer to cover them as well.
* Titan

  * Tumults after triple gaols.
  * Tumults after healer gaol. Has the added benefit of also covering the tank for Rock Buster and Mountain Buster.
* Ultima

  * Predation (for limit break generation when eating the Afterburner)
  * Tumults during Active Phase 1
  * During Annihilation (Make sure to cover the Searing Wind healer before they leave the group!)
  * Aetheric Boom
  * Any of the primals during Roulette

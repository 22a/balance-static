# Gearing FAQ



## What's the difference between gear set gcd speeds?
Having a faster GCD tier can help with squeezing in extra Drills and Air Anchors in tight uptime window such as before E3S Maelstroms. It also gives you an opportunity in every Wildfire cycle to realign Drill and Anchor casts for some more flexibility or to fix a mistake in case you delay either of them by accident. Additionally, it can help reduce Drill/Anchor drifting caused by latency based clipping in Hypercharges.

## Why does BiS have SkS or an odd gcd speed?
SkS scales auto-attack and Wildfire damage and the gains can sometimes out-weight gains from other melds. The most efficient GCD speed depends entirely on itemization, what stats are available on gear, and what can be melded. It's very possible to have a gear set outside of the efficient (2.50, 2.44, 2.38) GCD speeds still be the best option for the tier. BiS sets are calculated with the Gear Set Calculator Spreadsheet under Tools if you want to investigate it further.

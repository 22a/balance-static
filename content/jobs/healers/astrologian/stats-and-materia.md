# Astrologian Stats and Materia

## What should I meld?

Outside of Best in Slot, your meld priority should be;

1. Piety to comfort (if needed)
2. Sps if you want to hit a certain GCD tier
3. Crit
4. Det/dh
5. Sps.

That said, the difference between meld setups is so small overall that you could opt for Det over Crit, or take more Spell Speed than usual if that's what you're more comfortable with during prog. The raw effect of the stats is quite insignificant as long as you're melding something that you're going to make use of.

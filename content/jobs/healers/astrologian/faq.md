## What Sect Should I Use?

Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn't put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.

## What about Macros?

**MACRO ABILITIES ARE NEVER OPTIMAL FOR AST, EVER.**

Does not matter what it is. If it's Star, if it's cards, if it's Malefic (heavens no), macros should never be desired. If using any, the goal should ALWAYS be to work out of needing them. Yes, this includes you controller players. I play on it without any macros, you can too.

There is one set of macro types I will excuse under the condition that using them, the player understands:

1. It is objectively unoptimal and is costing them DPS and performance
2. They are training wheels that should be worked out of ideally
3. They will likely cause hiccups with queueing at times and discombobulate you

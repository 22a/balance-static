# Openers


**Remember that the exact ability usage in these openers is not strict.**  
 If you need to use a heal in the opener, or hold an AF stack for later healing or to fill a later ruin 2 weave/movement, do so. This is the ability usage you'd do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.

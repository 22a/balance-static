General stat priority pre-BiS:

1. Piety to comfort (read below)
2. Spell Speed (until 1015 for 2.43 GCD)
3. Critical Hit
4. Direct Hit = Determination
5. Spell Speed

**Piety** is the most important substat if it allows you to continue rolling your GCDs.\

However, good oGCD planning and communicating your heals with your co-healer to avoid unnecessary GCD healing will have the highest impact on your MP efficiency. Correct usage of your MP generating/saving abilities (Lucid Dreaming, Aetherflow, Energy Drain, Recitation) will also help you maintain your MP throughout a fight. Even during prog, good usage of HQ Super Ethers will allow easier recovery from raises and deaths than simply stacking Piety. 

If you're looking for a good "safe" Piety to start out with, take a look at the Piety in the recommended sets and add a bit more, and be sure to have Super-Ethers :hq: available. You can always adjust later on if you are constantly finding yourself with either an excess or lack of MP.\

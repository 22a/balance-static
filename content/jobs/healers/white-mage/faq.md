# White Mage FAQ

## How should movement and weaving be handled?

White Mage is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. An informed WHM will preposition themselves such that they will move as little as possible during an encounter to maximise efficiency and uptime. Where this becomes unfeasible, the options below — to be prioritised from top to bottom — will enable efficient movement:

1.  Reposition using slidecasts.
1.  Reapply Dia (~3 seconds remaining).
1.  Use Swiftcast and Glare without clipping, but consider holding Swiftcast for Raise in prog.
1.  Use Afflatus Rapture to do necessary healing, or use Afflatus Misery.
1.  Apply Regen to do necessary healing.
1.  Use an Afflatus heal, spending a Lily.
1.  Reapply Dia outside the usual reapplication window (>6 seconds remaining).

Keep in mind that the best available option(s) may vary depending on the encounter and party composition. Extended movements may involve a combination of the above, though movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning and the correct utilization of Dia and slidecasting.

"Necessary healing", in this context, describes healing that cannot be covered by your, or another healer's, oGCDs.

## When should Afflatus heals be used?

A simple rule of thumb for spending Lilies is to use them when they can help accomplish at least two of the following:

*  Necessary, effective healing.
*  Weaving oGCDs (bonus points for double weaving).
*  Efficient movement.

Remember that these are only guidelines and that Lilies may be used in other circumstances. The optimal use of Afflatus heals at any given moment will depend on encounter-specific rotations. **It's perfectly fine to preserve all three Lilies if their use won't meet the above criteria**.

## Should Afflatus Misery be used every 90s?

No. Building Blood Lily stacks for the sole purpose of using Afflatus Misery is a loss over rolling Glare casts.

Glare  |  Glare  |  Glare  | Glare  = 4 GCDs for 1200p \
Rapture | Rapture | Rapture | Misery = 4 GCDs for 900p

## Should Afflatus Misery be ignored?

No. The DPS benefits of Afflatus heals are nullified if Afflatus Misery is never used, and the Lilies spent to unlock it will only ever be as effective as standard GCD heals. Use Afflatus Misery for any of the following reasons should the encounter allow it:

*  To create a weaving window for oGCDs.
*  To create a movement window for mechanics.
*  To align with raid buff windows for extra damage return.
*  To clear the Blood Lily stack and begin building another Afflatus Misery.

## Should Afflatus heals be prioritised over other healing spells?

Prioritise Afflatus heals over other GCD heals like Cure II and Cure III. When choosing between an Afflatus heal and an oGCD heal, take into consideration how much healing potency you need and if you're going to clip to apply them.

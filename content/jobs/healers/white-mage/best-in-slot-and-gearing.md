# What's my BIS?!
You have a lot to choose from! Healer sets are highly subjective based on personal and party play.  The sets below all use relic weapon, for edenmorn weapon versions check the gear spreadsheet!


## Comfy mid-piety sets:
Safe to use in environments where raises and non lily GCD heals are expected, when in doubt, pick one of these sets


2.34 GCD | 912 Piety  
Mid-speed general-use set  
Relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/502c5c88-c1b4-4cd5-8a39-c0508f5900db>  
Non-Relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/8f86fdc2-5d73-420e-a8e2-15411eef27fa>  


2.41 GCD | 852 Piety  
Low-speed, high ping friendly general-use set  
Relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/6e55889b-506c-48c6-b8a3-eeaff1fbfc0b>  
Non-relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/784d4a8c-0056-499d-84be-f361942c5a65>


## Low-piety, recommended damage set

2.34 GCD | 682 Piety  
Relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/9b5f25e1-340a-462a-89b6-4d649a094cf2>  
Non-Relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/f64a2a88-d150-4c84-80a9-b2c4b64703cd>  
Mid-speed, well-suited to more organized reclears, risky in pf and on prog, especially e12s.
Similar alternatives using Smoked Chicken and Edenmorn Earring can be found in the gear calculator.


## Minimum piety speed set
2.26 GCD | 340 Piety  
Relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/a5c68e57-2f6a-45bb-87d0-557991e17f48>  
Non-Relic: <https://etro.gg/gearset/36222ba8-4f56-4b6a-a1c9-d67aadd3d4fd>  
High-speed, speedkill only set.  Extremely risky and **will** run out of mana if any gcd healing or raises are required, or the fight goes too long.  **Not for general use.**

# Gear calculator
The best set for you may not be listed here! These sets and a few more and a cursed one are listed on this relative damage calc spreadsheet + etro links are here: 

<http://bit.ly/whmgearcalc>

You're strongly encouraged to make a copy of this sheet and plug in your own sets and see how they compare! This sheet gives a relative approximated estimated idea of how sets stack up using the TJ’s damage formula. It's by no means a perfect representation. Check the readme tab in the doc for more info.  
*(Big thanks to @Fürst Blumier Blumier for making this, @Laqi#0795 for the original design, and Allagan Studies for the damage formula!)*

# What gear should I use for ultimates??

## TEA Prog set
2.42 GCD | 1364 Piety  
<https://etro.gg/gearset/7cdc296b-4889-43c9-ad1b-a21fab6e6001>  
Flexible set able to accommodate a wide range of Piety levels and 2 different GCDs. Standard setup uses Smoked Chicken for 2.42, you can use Twilight Popoto Salad for 2.41 or Golden Pineapple Juice for some extra Piety. You can put Piety instead of Det on Relic if desired (in any amount you want) and the Piety melds can be stripped out for Det/DH if you feel you wanna go lower (Existing Det melds can be swapped to DH too).  
**Edenmorn Chest is BiS, use 520 Nier or Augmented Deepshadow otherwise**  
**TL;DR: Use this as a starting point and adjust to comfort**  
*(Shamelessly stolen from Tonto, even the blurb, I didn't even ask permission.  )*

## UWU / UCOB 
The damage checks in UWU and UCOB are trivial with current gear, food and potions. The biggest gear upgrade **by far** is the 515 or 535 relic, as you can cap multiple substats, but again they are hardly required.  I personally recommend 1k+ piety for prog, with your remaining gear prioritizing crit > det/sps wherever possible.  Don't worry about getting perfect stats, they won't make a difference for anything but rank 1.

### The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)
Gear at item level 470 and above will cap both substats.  
Relic stats: 318 crit, 318 det, 318 sps, 213+ piety

### The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCOB)
Gear at item level 418 and above will cap both substats.  
Relic stats: 280 crit/det/sps/piety

## Is X Cane better than Y Cane?
As of patch 5.55:  
535 Relic > Edenmorn Cane > Augmented Cryptlurker Cane >= Diamond Zeta Cane >= 515 Relic Cane > Emerald Cane > 510 relic cane >= Cryptlurker Cane >= Augmented Exarchic Cane

Still not sure what to grab? Use the [gear calculator](#gear-calculator)!

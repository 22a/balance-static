You have a lot to choose from! Healer sets are highly subjective based on personal and party play.  The sets below all use relic weapon, for edenmorn weapon versions check the gear spreadsheet!


## Comfy mid-piety sets:
Safe to use in environments where raises and non lily GCD heals are expected, when in doubt, pick one of these sets


2.34 GCD | 912 Piety
Mid-speed general-use set
Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/502c5c88-c1b4-4cd5-8a39-c0508f5900db
Non-Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/8f86fdc2-5d73-420e-a8e2-15411eef27fa


2.41 GCD | 852 Piety
Low-speed, high ping friendly general-use set
Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/6e55889b-506c-48c6-b8a3-eeaff1fbfc0b
Non-relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/784d4a8c-0056-499d-84be-f361942c5a65


## Low-piety, recommended damage set

2.34 GCD | 682 Piety
Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/9b5f25e1-340a-462a-89b6-4d649a094cf2
Non-Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/f64a2a88-d150-4c84-80a9-b2c4b64703cd
Mid-speed, well-suited to more organized reclears, risky in pf and on prog, especially e12s.
Similar alternatives using Smoked Chicken and Edenmorn Earring can be found in the gear calculator.


## Minimum piety speed set
2.26 GCD | 340 Piety
Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/a5c68e57-2f6a-45bb-87d0-557991e17f48
Non-Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/36222ba8-4f56-4b6a-a1c9-d67aadd3d4fd
High-speed, speedkill only set.  Extremely risky and **will** run out of mana if any gcd healing or raises are required, or the fight goes too long.  **Not for general use.**

The best set for you may not be listed here! These sets and a few more and a cursed one are listed on this relative damage calc spreadsheet + etro links are here:

You're strongly encouraged to make a copy of this sheet and plug in your own sets and see how they compare! This sheet gives a relative approximated estimated idea of how sets stack up using the TJ’s damage formula. It's by no means a perfect representation. Check the readme tab in the doc for more info.  
*(Big thanks to @Fürst Blumier Blumier for making this, @Laqi#0795 for the original design, and Allagan Studies for the damage formula!)*

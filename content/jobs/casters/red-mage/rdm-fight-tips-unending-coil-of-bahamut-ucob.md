# General Fight Tips

## Manafication

Manafication is changed in Shadowbringers by a trait at Lv.74 which means that in Lv.70 content it functions the same way it did in Stormblood: with no damage buff and a 120s cooldown. As a result of there being no damage buff it should be used slightly differently than at Lv.80.
While you should still aim to finish phases with as much Black and White mana as possible, in the scenario that your mana is at 60 | 60 or below, you can use Manafication during downtime during or in between phases to get it on cooldown faster. This should be done whenever possible to avoid the possibility of losing a use of Manafication throughout the fight.

## Potion Usage

Potions in UCoB should be used during raid buff windows in order to maximise the gain received from them.
Although Manafication does not grant a damage buff, just as with level 80 content you should still aim to get 2 melee combos under a potion buff whenever you can.

## Displacement Usage

Due to the Neurolinks that are placed around the arena for the entire fight, be wary of the angles you Displace at as it is possible for you to land in a Neurolink and gain the damage down debuff, causing you to lose considerable damage if you immediately begin casting and resolve a spell.

## Embolden Usage

As always, Embolden should be used to achieve the best possible gains for your group. While many groups will likely opt to use 120s raid buffs at the start of each phase, it may be worth suggesting to your group that you instead use your second set of 120s buffs at the end of Twintania. By doing this, you gain an 8th use of Embolden, versus having only seven uses if you were to hold for the start of Nael.
The reason for this is that you will only be using two sets of 120s raid buffs during Bahamut Prime, regardless of whether or not you hold Embolden at the end of Twintania. By using buffs on cooldown, you get three Emboldens during the first two phases as opposed to two.

## Vercure Usage

As with other fights in the game, Vercure can be used during downtime in-between phases in order to prepare a Dualcast for when the boss becomes targetable again. In addition to this, in phases where the boss isn’t targetable and heavy raid damage is going out, Vercure can be used to assist your healers with healing wherever it may be needed. This is especially useful during the Trios in Bahamut Prime as the boss is often not targetable during these mechanics.

# Phase 1: Twintania

## Opener

![](https://i.imgur.com/gL0nF0U.png)

Due to the first Twister cast around the 6th GCD, you will likely have to use Swiftcast after your 5th GCD in order to not be hit. As a result of this, there are multiple options with what you can do for your opener because of Displacement.
The recommended method is to use a 3-11 opener. By using this opener, you will not lose a Displacement and will also be able to use your Embolden on time. In this opener, you would be using Displacement after the first Fireball stack. Twisters will still be present at this time, so angle yourself with caution. 
If you opt to do an X-8 opener instead, you will either have to use Displacement early and hold your Embolden slightly, or drop the Displacement cast before your Manafication, as you cannot double weave Displacement without clipping under most circumstances.

## Hatch

If you are marked by a Hatch you should try to slidecast your way to the Hatch and minimise the potential damage loss from the Neurolink debuff.
If you are not able to get a Dualcast before you step into the Neurolink, you can cast a Jolt while in the Neurolink to prepare a Dualcast for when you step out of it. However, depending on how the boss is positioned relative to the Neurolink, you may not have the ability to resolve the Hatch before your next hardcast GCD. If you have both of your procs available while you are in a Neurolink, you can cast one of those in place of Jolt in order to generate more mana.
Be sure you wait for the debuff to fall off before you Dualcast, as it often takes a second for it to expire after stepping out. You can begin to slidecast with under 0.5 seconds left in the cast, generally, to help with making sure the Neurolink debuff drops off in time.

## Liquid Hell Bait

When the physical ranged is marked by Hatch, a backup person will be required to bait Liquid Hells. While it is generally advisable to have a healer—or a SMN, if your group has one—to do these backup baits, some groups may ask their RDM to do it. 
In the scenario that you are the backup baiter, consider holding Swiftcast when you can for any possible Liquid Hell baits, as it is not possible to cast in between each bait.
For the final pair of Hatches and Liquid Hells, a random person will be targeted by Liquid Hells. You may have enough mana for a melee combo in this scenario, so you can use this to keep uptime on the boss while avoiding the Liquid Hells.

## Displacement Usage

Many parts of Twintania will allow you to use Displacement safely. However, be sure to avoid jumping too far from the boss and accidentally baiting a Liquid Hell. With most push times, you will be able to aim for four uses of Displacement.

## Second Embolden

Most push timings will generally want to use 2nd set of 120s raid buff cooldowns before Twintania dies in order to gain a use before Bahamut Prime. You should discuss this opportunity with your group in order to decide the most optimal strategy for the group. 

## Addle Mitigation

Addle in this phase will be used to mitigate the Fireball stacks from Twintania. While you should discuss with your healers which should be addled, common ones to addle are the second Fireball before the first Neurolink drop if it is not skipped, and the Fireball during random Liquid Hell baits after the second Neurolink drop. You should avoid Addling the first Fireball to generate extra Limit Break Gauge.

# Phase 2: Nael Van Darnus

## Reopener

Entering this phase you should be near enough resources to do a double melee combo reopener. However, your reopener will vary depending on how much mana you ended the previous phase with. 

Depending on your push timing in Twintania, you may have to cast some GCDs for mana before entering a melee combo. Despite this, you should still be able to get your first melee combo off without any problems. However, if the first quote ends with Iron Chariot instead of Thermionic Beam, you may have to use your second melee combo after moving out depending on your mana levels. 

If you need to wait until after Iron Chariot for your second melee combo, you can use Corps-a-Corps to get back in right after the AoE goes out in order to start your melee combo and also stack in time for Firescorched. 

## Maintaining Uptime

There are many mechanics in this phase that snapshot early and can kill you and the party instantly if not handled correctly. As such you should always be ready and willing to drop a cast if you need to in order to avoid a mechanic. Your priority should always be to stay alive, as losing 1 or 2 GCDs is far less of a loss compared to dying. Common mechanics where you may need to drop casts depending on alignment are Iron Chariot, Wings of Salvation and Thunderstruck.

## Divebombs

When Divebombs targets are being selected, you can preposition yourself between the boss and the first Divebomb marker. In the scenario that you are selected, you can slidecast into the marker while maintaining uptime. As markers come out, you can move around in a circular motion to the other Divebomb markers in the scenario that you are selected for one of those.
Something you can also consider doing is holding Displacement towards the middle of the phase so that you can have it available in the scenario you are marked with a Divebomb. You can use Displacement to get to your Divebomb position faster which can often help you gain an extra GCD if you are not prepositioned and need to move a large distance.

## Addle Mitigation

Addle in this phase will be used to mitigate Thermionic Beam. The most common mitigated with Addle is the Thermionic Beam in the beginning of the second quote, while another option is the Thermionic Beam after Divebombs if the quote is for a stack instead of a spread.

# Phase 3: Bahamut Prime

## Reopener

Depending on how much mana you end the previous phase with, you may have difficulty finishing 2 melee combos on Bahamut Prime if you are using Manafication here.
In the scenario that you do not have enough time to finish your second melee combo before the boss becomes untargetable for Quickmarch Trio, you can use Manafication when you are at or above 40 | 40 mana to get it on cooldown faster and do your second combo at the end of Quickmarch Trio.

## Damage Phases

This phase consists of multiple damage phases in between mechanics when the boss is targetable. Continue doing your rotation as normal during these phases, but beware of using heavy hitters such as Verflare/Verholy and Fleche as the boss is becoming untargetable as there is a high chance of it ghosting. You should also discuss with your party which of these short damage phases you will be using your buffs in for the highest possible damage output. 

## Fleche and Contre Sixte

Whenever the boss becomes targetable, you should immediately use Fleche in the first oGCD window available. By doing this, you allow yourself to get two casts of Fleche per damage window. 

You will only be able to use one Contre Sixte per damage window, so aim to use this when raid buffs are available.

## Addle Mitigation

Addle in this phase will be used to mitigate the raid-wide damage from Gigaflare. After every Trio, Bahamut will cast a Gigaflare, and a total of 2 (per caster) can be Addled throughout the phase.
Your second Addle usage in this phase will depend on your first one. If you are using Addle on the Gigaflare after Blackfire Trio, you can also Addle either the Gigaflare after Heavensfall Trio or the Gigaflare after Tenstrike Trio. If you Addle the Gigaflare after Fellruin Trio, your second Addle must be on the Gigaflare after Tenstrike Trio.

# Phase 4: Adds Phase

## Reopener

Try to come into this phase capped, or close to being capped, on black and white mana.
This is so that you can reopen the phase by hitting both bosses with seven Enchanted Moulinets, especially if you are using a potion at the beginning of this phase.
By using 2 Enchanted Moulinets and then using Manafication you can get seven Enchanted Moulinets on the bosses under both buffs and your potion.

## Impact Usage

As this phase has two bosses targetable, you should be using Impact whenever the bosses are stacked. There are many mechanics which will cause them to split, during which you should use your single target GCDs as usual. 

## Enchanted Moulinet Usage

Since the melee combo does not have Scorch at Lv.70, EnMoulinet is a gain in 2 target scenarios. You should spend all of your black and white mana on EnMoulinets in this phase as opposed to your melee combo. Be sure to spend any mana you have before the phase ends, as you will be going into the next phase with no resources.

## Uptime

While it is important to keep uptime on the bosses whenever possible, be wary of greeting GCD’s in this phase as it can greatly affect Golden Bahamut. Any weakness gained here will carry over to the next phase when you receive Phoenix’s Blessing, so don’t be afraid to drop a GCD when necessary. 

## Addle Mitigation

Addle in this phase will be used on one of the Megaflare casts from Nael. It is generally advised to Addle the first Megaflare cast as Addling the second one may cause you to not have Addle back in time for the first Morn Afah in Golden Bahamut.

---

# Phase 5: Golden Bahamut

## Opener

Due to the party death during the Phoenix transition, you will be entering this phase with no black or white mana. As a result of this, you should use Vercure to prepare a Dualcast before Golden Bahamut is targetable and then begin casting as normal.
If you use a potion in the Adds phase, you will not be able to use a potion in your opener, but a later potion is optimal for Red Mage as you can perform a double melee combo later in the phase during the final burn window.

## Phoenix’s Blessing

The Phoenix’s Blessing buff given to you for this phase enables you to deal double damage—however, you will lose this buff if you die. Be cautious to not be killed in this phase, as a lost buff can be the cause of an enrage. As with other phases, do not hesitate to drop a cast if you are not certain you will be able to finish the cast without dying. 

## Swiftcast Usage

There will be many times in Golden Bahamut that you will need to quickly move in order to dodge an Exaflare. It is generally advisable to hold Swiftcast in this phase for times when you need to quickly move and can not finish a cast.

## Final Burst

Toward the end of the phase, you should aim for a double melee combo under potion and buffs. This may require you to overcap on mana for a couple of GCDs, but it will be a gain overall. 

## Addle Mitigation

Addle in this phase will be used to mitigate the Morn Afah stacks. You should discuss with your party where you will be using Addle, as there are 5 total casts of Morn Afah.
Using 90s mitigations (Addle included) on the odd Morn Afahs will give you 3 total uses, so you should be using it on 1, 3, and 5 if you have 1 caster.
If you have 2 casters and it is your job to mitigate the 2nd and the 4th Morn Afah, do consider the timing of where you use addle for the 2nd Morn Afah. You have to use it a few seconds before the cast for Morn Afah begins, or it will be late for the 4th one.

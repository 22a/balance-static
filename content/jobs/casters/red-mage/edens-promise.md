### Movement for Brambles into Anti-Air/Wide-Angle

In the first minute of the fight, it is preferred to hold your Swiftcast. This allows your Dualcast window to align better for later mechanics, such as for placing your bramble and tethers. What you need to use for the tether movement may vary based on the Brambles strategy your group does, but generally, a single Dualcast will likely be enough, adding Sprint if necessary. Do note that you can move as soon as the purple circle appears around your character, as the tethers have already snapshotted at this point.

For the first Anti-Air and Wide-Angle, you can handle these mechanics in a variety of ways. One option is to use Displacement to jump to the corner where your safe spot is, but this may not work with all strategies. You can also take this opportunity to use the Swiftcast you held up until now, and also Sprint, if you have not used it yet, to safely move into place. If the first mechanic is Anti Air, you have time to do an extra Dualcast before moving into position, as the first AOE she uses in this scenario is a circular AOE directly around her. If she casts Wide-Angle first, you can safely cast another Dualcast by standing behind her hitbox at the edge, outside of the range of the arena-wide cleave, and then quickly move into your corner before the following mechanics. An example clip of movement making use of Swiftcast can be found below:

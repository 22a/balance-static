RDM’s rotation revolves around casting spells to build up black and white mana, then spending our accumulated mana on powerful enchanted weaponskills. Our casting phase is primarily defined by our “Dualcast” trait, which grants us a buff after every hardcasted spell that turns our next spell into an instantly cast spell. This means we will be alternating between hardcasting spells with low cast time, and using the Ddualcast buff to instantly cast spells with a longer cast time. As a result, we will never hardcast a spell with a 5+ second cast time outside of pre-pull scenarios.

## Levels 18-25

As RDM is a job that starts at 50, you’re guaranteed to have your AoE tools no matter which dungeon you sync to. 3+ target AoE in this level range is simply Verthunder II and Veraero II into Scatter. We do not have an AoE mana spender so do not bother using any enchanted weaponskills outside of single target.

For single target, we alternate between casting Jolt -> Verthunder and Jolt -> Veraero, keeping our mana levels relatively balanced. You only have a single melee combo step at this level range, but it is still worth using whenever you amass enough mana.

Use Corps-a-corps on cooldown (CD) and not for movement. It is a damaging oGCD that simply happens to move you.

## Levels 26-51

Our AoE rotation only has a minor change in this level range with the addition of Acceleration at 50, a buff that will make our next Scatter insta-cast and boost its potency. Acceleration can be used on CD during our AoE rotation.

In terms of single target, we get our Verfire and Verstone procs at level 26 and 30 respectively. They will replace Jolt in our dualcast GCD pairs when we get them from Verthunder and Veraero. Acceleration removes the cast time on our next Verthunder or Veraero and ensures they will give us a proc. Use this freely on CD as long as you will get a useful proc from it.

At 35 and 50, we will get additions to our single target melee combos. Build up enough mana to fully utilize whatever combo steps are available to you at your level; 35 for Riposte + Zwerchau, 50 for the full combo. 

We get a few damaging oGCDs in this level range, namely Displacement/Engagement (both level 40) and Fleche. Displacement and Engagement share the same cooldown and share the same damage potency, so we generally prefer Engagement for the shorter animation lock unless the movement from Displacement is useful. Fleche is one of our most powerful oGCDs and should be used on CD. 

## Levels 52-57

Our AoE rotation changes at level 52 with the addition of Enchanted Moulinet, our AoE mana spender. We can now mix in Enchanted Moulinets between our Verthunder II/Veraero II -> Scatter GCD pairs. 

At level 54, we get Vercure, which can actually be used offensively during downtime to prepare a Dualcast so we can instantly open on the next mob pack/boss with a strong GCD. Vercuring during downtime is a trick often used in endgame raids whenever the boss disappears, so it’s a good habit to get into early on.

Level 56 adds Contre Sixte, another powerful damaging oGCD that should be used on cooldown.

## Levels 58-67

Jolt is upgraded to Jolt II, while Scatter becomes Impact. While those upgrades do not affect our rotation in any meaningful manner, we do get two new oGCDs that are worth mentioning.

\*\*Embolden:\*\* Acquired at level 58, this is RDM’s party buff that should be used both in trash packs and bosses in dungeons instead of being saved exclusively for bosses. In general, Embolden is worth using on trash packs if your party can benefit from the full duration, though you may choose to hold it during smaller pulls that die too quickly. 

\*\*Manafication:\*\* Learned at level 60, Manafication instantly gives us 50 black and 50 white mana. We should use it in both AOE scenarios (granting us at least 2 free Enchanted Moulinets) and single target (for a free melee combo).

At level 64, we get Verraise, RDM’s most powerful recovery tool as it lets us dualcast a raise every other GCD. In dungeons, Verraise is generally not needed unless the healer is dead. In eight-player content, Verraise can easily salvage almost-wipes and should be used liberally for recovery when multiple people are dead. 

## Levels 68-77

We get our first combo finisher at level 68, which changes how we use Enchanted Moulinet in AOE situations. Verholy/Verflare can be used when we have accumulated three Mana Stacks via our enchanted melee combo steps or Enchanted Moulinet, but the stacks disappear if we use any other GCD. Therefore, we want to make sure that we have at least 60|60 mana before using Enchanted Moulinet so we can combo three Enchanted Moulinet into Verholy or Verflare, both of which do AoE damage. 

Our single target rotation does not change aside from the addition of Verholy/Verflare at the end of our melee combo. 

## Levels 78+

Level 78 introduces the Enhanced Manafication trait, which makes Manafication grant multiple stacks of a 5% magical damage buff. This essentially means that we always want to go into a combo (whether 3x Enchanted Moulinet or E.Riposte > E.Zwerchau > E.Redoublement) after a use of Manafication so as to not waste our 5% magical damage buff on weaker GCDs. Be aware that Manafication by itself does not guarantee enough melee for a full AoE combo, so make sure you have at least 10|10 mana before using Manafication in AoE situations. 

We get additional combo finishers with Scorch at level 80 and Resolution at 90, as well as some spell upgrades, but our AoE and single target rotations are otherwise unaffected.

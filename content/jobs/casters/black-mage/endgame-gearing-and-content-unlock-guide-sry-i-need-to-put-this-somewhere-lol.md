## Introduction

This is a comprehensive guide aimed towards players entering endgame – Level 90 – for the first time and getting overwhelmed with FFXIV's gear progression systems. This guide will help you get an understanding of how FFXIV’s endgame systems work, as well as how to gear up and what types of endgame PvE content exist.

Step 1. Finish MSQ, get AF Gear, and farm Tomestones for gear

### Gear Progression

Upon reaching the level cap, gear progression is based on Item Level, commonly referred to as i# or iL#. The stronger the item level, the stronger the piece of equipment is. Upgrading gear is very straightforward in FFXIV.

* Endgame gear with higher item levels are acquired through dungeons, trials, raids, crafting, and tomestones.
* All duties have a required minimum item level. This can be bypassed if queueing with a full premade party.
* The maximum item level is increased during each expansion and each raid patch cycle (even numbered patches), which occur every 7-8 months. The base item level for that patch’s content is the maximum armour item level for the previous patch cycle +10.
* On odd-numbered patches, the maximum item level is not increased, and more ways to upgrade gear are introduced with Alliance raids and Hunts. Odd-numbered patches are commonly referred to as catch-up patches.
* Gear is divided into Weapon and Gear. Gear has Left Side (Head, Chest, Hands, Waist, Legs, Feet), and Right Side (Waist, Earrings, Necklace, Bracelet, Ring, Ring).

  * Right side gear equips are considered “accessories”. 
  * The Waist, despite appearing on the left side, is upgraded the same way as right side gear. However, Waist is generally not considered in drop tables with every other Left side piece. The Waist item slot is confirmed to be removed in the next FFXIV expansion, Endwalker.
* The current highest item level is i535 for weapons, and i530 for armor.
* Best-in-Slot (BiS) gear is the best gear you can possibly have at the time. BiS mixes and matches the strongest endgame sets. Accurate and up-to-date BiS lists can be found on [SaltedXIV](https://saltedxiv.com) or [the Balance](http://discord.com/thebalanceffxiv).

* All endgame content from previous expansions rewards Tomestones of Poetics, which can be exchanged for any previous expansion’s endgame gear.
* All endgame content from Shadowbringers rewards Tomestones of Revelation and Tomestones of Allegory.
* Allegory is uncapped, meaning you can get as many as you want. Revelation is capped at 450 tomes per weekly lockout.
* Tomestones of Allegory can be exchanged for i490 Crystarium Gear, which can be upgraded to i500 Augmented Crystarium Gear with upgrade items from The Puppets’ Bunker, the Hunt, or Eden’s Verse (Savage).
* Tomestones of Revelation can be exchanged for i520 Cryptlurker Gear, which can be upgraded to i530 Augmented Cryptlurker Gear with upgrade items from Eden’s Promise (Savage).

### Roulettes

Roulettes queue you up for a random duty selected from those available within the Roulette.

* Roulettes are part of the daily lockout.
* Roulettes award experience (at non-level cap), GC Seals, Tomestones, and gil.
* Expert Roulette comprises the two to three newest dungeons released and rewards many Tomestones of Revelation and Allegory.

  * As of Patch 5.5, includes the dungeons Matoya’s Relict and Pagl’than.
  * Rewards an addition 50 Revelation in addition to the dungeon rewards.
  * Expert Roulette requires you to complete all dungeons within the roulette at least once to unlock.
  * Expert Roulette is the main way to cap tomes each week, as it takes roughly 15-25 minutes and gives you 1/5 of the tomes needed to cap.
* Level 80 Roulette comprises all Level 80 dungeons not in Expert Roulette.

  * Rewards an additional 100 Allegory and 15 Revelation in addition to the dungeon rewards.
* Level 50/60/70 Roulette comprises all Level 50, 60, and 70 dungeons.

### Extreme Trials and Tokens

Extreme Trials are a full party fight against a singular enemy. They are the gateway between casual content and Savage raiding, being a difficulty step above all casual combat content in the game. Most Extreme Trials reward strong weapons and a coveted Primal mount, while other Extreme Trials can reward accessories or even gear.

* Applicable to all non-ARR Extreme difficulty trials.
* There are no lockouts on Extreme Trials.
* Aside from dropping weapons, completion of an Extreme trial duty will reward one token.

  * 10 tokens can be traded for one weapon of choice (7 PLD Sword, 3 PLD Shield).
  * 99 tokens can be traded for the duty’s Extreme mount which is a rare drop. This is only applicable after a trial has been released for some time.

### Crafted Gear

Crafted gear is extremely important for high-end raider progression, and it’s important for anyone breaking into endgame content too!

* New crafted gear is released at the beginning of a raid patch cycle, at the patch’s base item level.
* This gear can be acquired through crafting them, having someone else craft them for you with your mats, or the marketboard.
* **Only HQ gear is relevant. Only purchase HQ gear.**
* These offer a good stepping stone to endgame for a new Level 80 player. A full set is expensive at the beginning of a patch cycle but quickly decreases in price.
* Currently, i450, i480, and i510 crafted gear exist.
* i450 Crafted Gear can be traded in along with Allegory materials for i460 Augmented Gear.
* i480 Crafted Gear can be traded in along with Allegory materials for i490 Augmented Gear.
* As of Patch 5.5, i510 Crafted Gear can be traded in with Allegory materials for i520 Augmented Gear.

### Acquisition of Materia

Materia are gems that you put in your gear to enhance it, giving you additional substats. After you acquire endgame gear, you must get materia to meld into them to maximize their potential and customize your stats. Almost all gear has two materia slots, with some gear such as Ultimate weapons having three and Relic gear having five. 

* You can meld gear at any Materia Melder NPC, or meld gear yourself if you have a crafting job leveled.
* Crafted gear can be “overmelded”, allowing you to put up to five materia in them. Only players with crafting jobs leveled can overmeld gear.
* Materia comes in eight grades, and the current endgame grades are Grade VIII and Grade VII.
* Grade VIII is the best materia available, while Grade VII is used strictly for overmelds. Cracked Stellaclusters can be traded in for Grade VIII materia, while Cracked Planiclusters can be traded in for Grade VII materia. They can be acquired from the following sources:

  * All max level dungeons randomly drop materia, which can be Grade VIII or Grade VII.
  * The Hunt rewards many materia:

    * Rank A mobs sometimes drop Cracked Stellaclusters and Cracked Planiclusters
    * Rank S mobs always drop Cracked Stellaclusters and Cracked Planiclusters
    * 400 Sacks of Nuts can be traded in for any Grade VIII materia of your choice, and 150 Sacks of Nuts can be tradedin for any Grade VII materia of your choice.
* Converting fully spiritbound endgame gear also gives a chance at Grade VIII materia.
* The Adventurer in Need bonus for Duty Roulette: Leveling and Duty Roulette: Alliance rewards two Cracked Planiclusters and one Cracked Stellacluster.
* Wondrous Tails sometimes has Cracked Stellaclusters or Cracked Planiclusters as a reward.
* Materia can easily be bought on the Marketboard for gil.
* **Melding your gear is extremely important for endgame content, as it gives you many substats.**

### The Hunt

Track dangerous mobs in order to acquire materia for your endgame gear as well as extra Tomestones. Hunts are the world bosses of FFXIV, which spawn in the overworld at regular intervals. Some rare hunts have difficult spawn conditions, but doing them is well worth the reward.

* Hunts are usually coordinated with a third-party software, Discord, mainly used for VOIP and chatting. In fact, a ton of endgame and social content use Discord. You can get Discord as a mobile app on iOS or Android, open it in a web browser, or download the application on desktop.
* Hunts reward a currency which can be used to purchase gear, materia, and upgrade items. Hunts will also drop Tomestones.

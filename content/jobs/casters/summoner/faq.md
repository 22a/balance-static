  - question: Should I do a 110s rotation? 120s? 60/55?
    answer: For full uptime fights, you’ll have to look at your killtime to see if
      110s or 60/55 would gain a Demi-Summon usage by the end of the fight. For
      fights with periods of downtime, check the Summoner channels in the
      Balance discord for up-to-date encounter rotation recommendations.
  - question: Why am I only getting seven Wyrmwaves / Scarlet Flames?
    answer: "For Demi-Phoenix, double check that you’re not missing the first
      Scarlet Flame. If you are, double check that you are doing one of the
      entrance methods from the guide.

      \r

      For Demi-Bahamut, ensure that you are late-weaving Summon Bahamut
      and that the last two GCDs are instant casts.


      For both, also make sure that:


      * You are not using Enkindle too late into the Demi-Summon window


      * You are not moving a large amount close to the end of the window\r


      * You are not clipping or otherwise losing GCD uptime"

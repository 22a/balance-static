title: Ultimates
---
# The Unending Coil of Bahamut

## General:

* Ultimates are riddled with downtime mechanics and thus there is no loop to follow. The general idea for Ultimates is to map out your rotation for each phase and be as optimal as possible in the usage of your Meikyo Shisui and Higanbana (and Tsubame for level 80).
* In stark comparison to Savage that also means you generally want to avoid the usage of Hagakure unless it's required for you to start a phase with a specific Sen setup.
* For Potion/Tincture timings always make sure they catch your burst window.

## UCoB:

* Twintania: Start with Midare 1st to avoid casting Higanbana as the first Twister happens. 2 Higanbanas.
* Nael: 2 Higanbanas.
* Bahamut Trios: Don't use Higanbana.
* Adds: Higanbana on both, then 2 target Tenka Goken rotation. 2 Higanbanas per target.
* Golden: Nothing special to mention.

## Pot timings:

* 1st: Twintania, standard timing.
* 2nd: Bahamut, before 1st GCD.
* 3rd: Adds, standard timing.
* 4th: Golden, as soon as it comes off cooldown (and catches your burst).

# The Epic of Alexander

## General:

* Ultimates are riddled with downtime mechanics and thus there is no loop to follow. The general idea for Ultimates is to map out your rotation for each phase and be as optimal as possible in the usage of your Meikyo Shisui and Higanbana (and Tsubame for level 80).
* In stark comparison to Savage that also means you generally want to avoid the usage of Hagakure unless it's required for you to start a phase with a specific Sen setup.
  â€¢ For pot timings always make sure they catch your burst window.

## TEA:

* Living Liquid: Start with Higanbana but save Guren (don't use Senei) for AoE. Ideally use Guren on LL + hand + doll, 2 target Tenka Goken rotation, 2 Tsubames (Kaeshi: Setsugekka is slightly better in a vacuum but phase/kill time can be in favor of Kaeshi: Goken so you need to test it yourself), 2 Higanbanas on LL, 1-2 Higanbanas on hand.
* BJ & CC: Depending on phase/kill time and your Sen setup, starting with Midare (Tsubame) can lead to better results but applying Higanbana to both targets first is generally favorable. Use Guren to cleave both, 2-3 Higanbanas per target depending on kill time, for Tsubame the same conditions apply as in the LL phase.
* Alex Prime: Don't use Higanbana. If you use Senei right after Inception, Guren will be up in time to cleave both CC and BJ in Judgement Formation.
* Perfect Alex: Ideally use the 3 Sen 100 Kenki opener. 1 Higanbana before FCA, 1 Higanbana before FCB, 2 Higanbanas after FCB.

## Pot timings:

* 1st: Standard pot timing on LL.
* 2nd: Before 1st GCD on Alex Prime for prog OR end of BJ & CC for logs (depending on phase/kill time).
* 3rd: Perfect Alex 1st GCD.
* 4th: Last burst window after Almighty Judgement.

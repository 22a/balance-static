Your standard opener which, due to the earlier DoT application, is ahead in output for the majority of any given encounter.


## Midare 1st:

Should be reserved for encounters with a phase or kill time such that you are able to land an additional Midare/Tsubame where Higanbana 1st would not.

# Samurai Non-Standard Openers:

## Alternative Higanbana 1st:
[Standard](https://i.imgur.com/Zy4X11C.png)  
[Single Weave](https://i.imgur.com/s14QrOA.png)  
[Video Example](https://youtu.be/0yN-9FW4E8w)

Alt. Higanbana 1st presents a real loop in which your burst phase plays exactly like your opener. It utilizes non-Yuki Meikyo, thus delaying the start of your burst by 1 GCD compared to the standard Higanbana 1st opener and is useful for encounters with awkward timing on mechanics with standard openers.


## Alternative Midare 1st:
[Standard](https://i.imgur.com/l42tiPv.png)  
[Single Weave](https://i.imgur.com/EhsSgGP.png)  
[Video Example](https://youtu.be/dISkbTs9VkM)

Alt. Midare 1st presents a real loop in which your burst phase plays exactly like your opener. It utilizes non-Yuki Meikyo, thus delaying the start of your burst by 1 GCD compared to the standard Midare 1st opener and is useful for encounters with awkward timing on mechanics with standard openers. Should be reserved for encounters with a phase or kill time such that you are able to land an additional Midare/Tsubame where Alt. Higanbana 1st would not.


## NoShifu/Cursed:
[Standard](https://i.imgur.com/265RkOl.png)  
[Video Example](https://youtu.be/ylPCw6h6PXE)  

Only useful if it grants you a Midare/Tsubame you wouldn't get with Midare 1st. Substantially worse than any other opener otherwise. If you reduce fillers by 1 in the first loop, you wait 0.5s on Tsubame. If you don't, you drift Tsubame by 1.5s. Pick your poison. This is called cursed for a reason. Standard filler for all following loops.  
Burst sequence: Hakaze Yuki Meikyo Gekko Kasha Midare Tsubame Gekko Bana

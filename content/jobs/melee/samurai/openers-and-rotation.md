# Samurai Standard Openers:

## Higanbana 1st:
Standard
Single Weave
Video Example
Your standard opener which, due to the earlier DoT application, is ahead in output for the majority of any given encounter.


## Midare 1st:
Standard
Single Weave
Video Example
Should be reserved for encounters with a phase or kill time such that you are able to land an additional Midare/Tsubame where Higanbana 1st would not.

Addendum: For non-standard openers use the !faq samnonstopeners command in bot_spam.

> Is X better than Y for me?

* For weapons: item level (ilvl)/weapon damage (wd) wins, regardless of substats.
* For armor: ilvl usually wins, unless 5 materia slots.
* For same-ilvl pieces: substat itemization can be in your favor or not depending on the rest of your gear and stat tiering.

When in doubt, use the Gear Planner - only here can you get an accurate answer for your setup!

> Samurai has positionals?!

The level 52 trait Kenki Mastery introduces positional bonuses for Gekko and Kasha, granting 5 extra Kenki.

* Gekko from the rear/back.
* Kasha from the flank/side.
* 5 Kenki equals 64+ potency after level 62 and 100+ potency before level 62.
* There are 7-8 Gekko/Kasha every 60s and fulfilling their positional requirements is a potency gain of 448-512 per minute.

Executing positionals correctly is an essential part of any melee DPS job.

> Is my ping too high to play Samurai?

High ping is bad, but not unplayable if you know how to work around it. Choose a slower GCD range and/or stick to single weaves if you notice consistent GCD clipping after double/iai-weaving.

> When is Higanbana worth using?

It takes ~42s (depending on server ticks) for Higanbana to outdamage Midare which is the point for Higanbana to be 100% worth doing.

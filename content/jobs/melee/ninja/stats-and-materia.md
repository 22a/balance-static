For your Best-in-Slot gear, you will generally be going for;

1. Weapon Damage
2. Dexterity
3. Crit
4. Direct Hit
5. Determination
6. Skill Speed.

*This is not 100% exact once you get to the max gear, but until you have that, that is the* priority in stats. 

For non-BIS pieces: Crit >>>> DH > DET >>>>>>>>>> SkS

## Basic Reaper Guide

Welcome to the Basic Guide for Reaper, which will cover everything you need to know to get started with becoming a Reaper! Included are an overview of the job’s playstyle, basic priority, abilities and core concepts.

Whether you’re a fresh level 90, a returning player, or just need a refresh, this guide will give you the tools you need to feel comfortable playing Reaper.

This guide is intended to be relatively basic and doesn’t go into huge explanations of specific situations or small nuances. If you’re looking for something specific, check out the more detailed guides below:

### How the Job Plays

Reaper is a fluid build-spender job with a flexible and fast paced burst window. Reaper has an upkeep mechanic in the form of a debuff called Death’s Design and has a small party buff that increases damage. It has a few powerful disconnect tools, including a gate-like ability that lets you teleport somewhere then teleport back to where you came from.

While Reaper has a powerful and flexible burst window, it does come with a few downsides. Its main burst mechanic, Enshroud, has the player using abilities between fast weaponskills which with high ping can feel incredibly clunky. It also has an extremely punishing mechanic in the form of Soul Reavers which will be lost if not spent properly.

Reaper can be played fluidly as a priority system or rigidly with planned burst windows allowing the job to have a low barrier of entry but have a very high skill expression ceiling. 

### Resources and Job Gauges

Reaper has access to a few resources that you will need to master to play the job:

![](/img/jobs/rpr/reapergauge1.png)

**Soul**: Soul is one of the main Resources that Reaper has and is represented by the Red bar on the job gauge. You build 10 of it by using your combo weaponskills (Slice, Waxing Slice, Infernal Slice, Spinning Scythe, Nightmare Scythe) and 50 by using Soul Slice / Scythe. You spend it on off-global abilities that generate Soul Reavers (Bloodstalk, Grim Swathe, Unveiled Gibbet, Unveiled Gallows, Gluttony). You spend 50 soul at a time and can store up to 100 so you have some wiggle room on when you use it.

**Shroud**: Shroud is the another main resource that Reaper has and is represented by the Blue bar on the job gauge. You build 10 Shroud by spending Soul Reavers (the resource you get from spending Soul) on the powerful weapon skills Gibbet, Gallows or Guillotine. Reavers must be spent on Shroud generating skills, using any other weaponskill will have them fall off immediately. While most Soul Spenders generate 1 Soul Reaver, Gluttony will generate 2. You can also build 50 Shroud by using Plentiful Harvest, which is only available once every two minutes.  50 Shroud is spent on a transformative buff called Enshroud and you can hold up to 100 Shroud at a time.

**Enshroud**: Enshroud is Reapers burst window which changes how the Reaper looks, activates a job gauge and changes a few abilities and weaponskills. For more detailed information on what changes, visit the Skill Details page. When you first Enshroud you generate 5 Blue Orbs (Lemure Shroud) which can be spent on the rapid 1.5s global cooldown weaponskills Void Reaping, Cross Reaping and Grim Reaping. When spending a Blue Orb this way it will generate a Purple Orb (Void Shroud) which you can spend in sets of two on off-global abilities Lemure’s Slice and Lemure’s Scythe. Lastly you can end the Enshroud phase by spending all of your Blue Orbs or by using the powerful spell Communio. 

### Basic Rotation

#### Reaper Fundamentals

* Gibbet and Gallows are positional weaponskills. Gibbet receives additional damage if you use it from the targets flank and Gallows receives the bonus if used from targets rear. These abilities also buff each other, whenever you use Gibbet your next Gallows will be buffed and when you use Gallows your next Gibbet will be buffed. This buff lasts for 60 seconds and will also upgrade your Blood Stalk into an Unveiled Gibbet or Unveiled Gallows based on whichever buff you have. When you see these weaponskills mentioned, you can do either/or, but always make sure you are using the buffed version if applicable.

  * The Unveiled Gibbet or Gallows does not consume the buff.
* Shadow of Death applies the Death's Design debuff to your target, Whorl of Death applies the debuff to all targets within 5 yalms. This debuff can stack on itself with a maximum duration of 60s.
* The following skills are upgraded when you use Enshroud

  * Gibbet turns into Void Reaping
  * Gallows turns into Cross Reaping
  * Guillotine turns into Grim Reaping
  * Bloodstalk turns into Lemure's Slice
  * Grim Swathe turns into Lemure's Scythe
* Void Reaping and Cross Reaping buff each other similarly to how Gibbet and Gallows do. Whenever you use Void Reaping your next Cross Reaping will deal more damage. This buff does not persist when Enshroud ends so you are able to start on whichever Reaping skill you want every enshroud. When you see these weaponskills mentioned, you can do either/or, but always make sure you are using the buffed version if applicable.
* Soul Sow is spell with a 5 seconds cast time in combat but is instant outside of Combat. When applied, the Soul Sow ability will change into Harvest Moon. Harvest Moon is a long-range spell that does a large amount of AoE damage. There are a few ways to utilize this ability:

  * Harvest Moon whenever you have to disengage from an enemy for longer than global cooldown.
  * Harvest Moon when you are able to deal AoE damage with it
  * Harvest Moon at least once each encounter.
  * Soul Sow before every boss pull and in-between dungeon packs.

#### The Opener:

![](/img/jobs/rpr/early_gluttony.png)

* Soul Before the pull
* Use a potion/tincture of Strength with 3s left on the countdown
* Begin casting Harpe with 2s left on the countdown > Ingress into boss if necessary
* Shadow of Death > Arcane Circle late into the global cooldown
* Soul Slice > Gluttony
* Gallows
* Gibbet
* Plentiful Harvest > Enshroud
* Cross Reaping
* Void Reaping > Lemure’s Slice
* Cross Reaping
* Void Reaping  > Lemure’s Slice
* Communio
* Soul Slice > Unveiled Gallows
* Gallows

#### Priority System:

Reaper can be played well by just following a priority system. Below is the recommended priority system for single target

* Spend Soul Reavers on Gibbet or Gallows (whichever is buffed) if you have them.

  * Use Guillotine if you can hit three or more enemies.
* Maintain Death’s design by using Shadow of Death.

  * Use Whorl of Death if you can hit three or more enemies.
* Arcane Circle on Cooldown (unless boss will jump during duration).
* Gluttony on Cooldown (as long as you can spend both reavers).
* Soul Slice on Cooldown (Do not overcap your Soul!)

  * Use Soul Scythe if you can hit three or more enemies.
* Plentiful Harvest if available.
* Enshroud when at 50 or more Shroud.

  * Alternate Void and Cross Reaping 4 times, as they buff each other.

    * Use Grim Reaping if you can hit three or more enemies.
  * Weave Lemure’s Slice after every other weapon skills.

    * Use Lemure’s Scythe if you can hit three or more enemies.
  * Use Communio when you have one Blue Orb remaining.
* Unveiled Gibbet / Unveiled Gallows / Blood Stalk if at 50 or more Soul.

  * Use Grim Swathe if you can hit three or more enemies.
* Combo actions as filler (Slice, Waxing Slice, Infernal Slice).

  * Use AoE combo (Spinning Scythe, Nightmare Scythe) if you can hit three or more enemies.
* Harvest Moon if you are not in melee range of the boss and it’s available.

  * Ensure to get one Harvest Moon between each pull and downtime!
* Harpe if you are not in melee range of the boss.

### Notable Utility

* Hell’s Ingress / Egress / Regress : Gap closer and Disengage abilities respectively. Using the other after using one will activate Regress, returning you to your previous location. Great for moving around boss mechanics.
* Arcane Crest: Provides a strong shield to yourself, that if broken gives the party a strong AoE regen. Use this often to help support the party.
* Feint: Reduces an enemies physical damage by a lot and magic damage by a little. Use on raidwides, tank busters or as requested from your healer or tanks.
* Arm’s Length: Prevents most knockbacks, great for maintaining uptime on the boss.
* True North: Allows you to ignore positional requirements. Use it when you can’t hit the flank or rear for Gibbet and Gallows respectively.
* Second Wind / Bloodbath : Self heal tools that can aid you in a pinch. Use them if you take unnecessary damage or find your health lower than the rest of the groups.

### Core Concepts

* Maintain uptime: Try to solve mechanics in a way that would allow you to stay on the bosses hit box. If you have to disengage you can utilize Harvest Moon to not lose any DPS. Harpe is also excellent if you have to disengage and can’t attack the boss.
* Hit your positionals: Gibbet and Gallows have rear and flank positionals respectively. Make sure you are attacking in the correct position when using them. Reaper has a lot of flexibility on when you can use these abilities so try to hold them if you can’t hit them. If you must hit them then utilize True North to hit them from any angle.
* Slidecasting: Soul Sow, Harpe and Communio all have cast times associated with them. You can start moving about 80% through the cast bar and still execute the ability. Utilize this to not miss damage and not take unnecessary damage.

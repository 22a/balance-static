    description: This set is *not* obtainable in the 2 weeks prior to savage
      release, and will be updated with crafted gear when those come out. For
      now, the suggested buying order of normal raid gear for the first two
      weeks until savage comes out is Boots + Gloves the first week, followed by
      Legs the second week.

# Dragoon Opener and Rotation

The Dragoon opener has a backbone of GCD actions that never changes, but the two different chunks of off-global skills (:pot::ds::bl::lc: and :hj::ssd::dfd::gsk::md:) can be shuffled within their respective “slots” in the opener if necessary for encounter-related timings.

Just keep in mind you should still never double weave with :pot:, :hj:, :ssd:, :dfd:, or :std: ever, opener or otherwise.

The basic GCD backbone of the rotation does change as you level:
64-80: :rt::de::ct::wt::fc:-:rt::vt::ft::fc::wt:
58-63: :tt::de::ct::wt:-(:tt::vt::ft::fc:)x2
56-57: :tt::de::ct:-(:tt::vt::ft::fc:)x2
50-55: :tt::de::ct:-(:tt::vt::ft:)x3
26-49: :tt::de:-(:tt::vt::ft:)x4
18-25: :tt::de:-(:tt::vt:)x6

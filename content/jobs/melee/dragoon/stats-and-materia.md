# Stat Priority and Gearing Up

When gearing up below maximum Item Level, you want to follow some general guidelines.
1. **Maximize Item Level** in every slot. There are very few exceptions to this rule, which can be confirmed via the [Gear Calculator](http://bit.ly/DRG-Gear)
2. **Build toward BiS** whenever possible.
3. **Prioritize Sub-Stats** in the general order of:  
Critical Hit Rate > Direct Hit Rate = Determination > Skill Speed

However, stats are not linear growth models. They function on a tiered system of bonuses. As such, it is **highly recommended** to use the provided Gear Calculation sheet in order to plug in your current set and work out your optimal melds!


> *How much Skill Speed should I use? What if I have too much?*  
 In general, we aim to have as low of Skill Speed as possible, but that shouldn’t dictate your gearing. You’ll want to aim for Best-in-Slot and always be gaining Item Level first and foremost. Having “too much” Skill Speed might make some things different than you’re used to, but it won’t have as large of an impact negatively as you think it will, assuming you still play properly.  
You can utilize the bot command !xivmath rspeed x.xx substituting x.xx for whatever GCD tier you want to find the required Skill Speed to reach it. Using !xivmath speed xxx where the xxx is a skill speed value will show you what your GCD would be at that speed.

With the pre-pull Geirskogul you will end up (pressing on cooldown) entering life during the second feather phase for lots of cleaved Nastrond.


# Ifrit Nails
You should be entering life around the time the nails spawn, allowing you to get a triple cleave 1-2 times on two nails + Ifrit at the narrow end of the bucket. You then roll right into a double-life prior to his jumps, while preparing for them. At the bitter end of the phase, if your kill time allows, you can enter life again and get 1 Nastrond on Ifrit before he jumps, saving the latter two for Titan.


# Buffs
You'll get 2 Lance Charge on Garuda, 1 on Ifrit (can be held for nails), and save your second on Ifrit for the Titan opener as the first of 2 on Titan. The duration of Garuda through the Magitek bits is around 8 minutes. Using Lance Charge on cooldown, the 6th would land at 7:30, during downtime. As such, 5 is the max you can get.

You will only get 1 Dragon Sight on each of the three bosses, so judge according to your personal kill times as to when would be best to use on each of them, to allow these three uses and still have it back for Ultima's opener.

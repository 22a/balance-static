# E9S

Your life at 3:00 should be delayed. You'll get 1 :nas: and :std: under :bl::lc: and the 3rd :nas: in this life will double tap the cloud add

To go even further beyond: delay the :bl::lc: 2 gcds to get an extra :nas: under these buffs. If the clouds live long enough you can re-enter life for another double tap :nas: on the cloud right before they feed.



# E11S
If you keep jump properly on cooldown you will have a naked life before sundered sky, and end the phase with 1 eye.



# E12S
## Phase 1
Use :hj: after :wt: in the opener to keep it on cooldown through Shiva and Titan.
!faq e12melee for uptime on Shiva.

:bl: at 0-4-8 for enrage kills.
:lc: can be delayed up to 30 seconds.
:ds: must use on cooldown. Tether bad targets if needed.

For sub-8:10 kill times, you can delay party 2 minute burst until 2:30, meaning :ds: and life for you.

Refer to specific strat for Lions.


## Phase 2
Must be early to land :ft: before Darkest Dance kb. 2.49 or faster makes this more consistent. Replacing 1 DHIT meld to 1 SKS meld solves this problem.

Start jumps after :ct: instead of :fc: to facilitate :ssd: to gap close perfectly after Darkest Dance.
Move :ls: to the :wt: to keep :hj: on cooldown.

Try to land :hj: before Basic Relativity stun.
Delay 2nd and 4th life (Intermediate Relativity)
Delay :ds: at 2m until after Basic's knockback.

:hj: should be on the first GCD after Intermediate. This gains +1 eye before Advanced Relativity if used on cooldown, which may gain +1 life cycle.

:ej: back to the boss at the end of Cataclysm's cast bar, but be sure you know the proper AoE dance to handle it. You can always maintain uptime if you handle it properly.

After Advanced Relativity, you can pot just before boss returns to fix buffs and cooldowns.

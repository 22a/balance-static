# E9S

Your life at 3:00 should be delayed. You'll get 1 Nastrond and Stardiver under Battle Litany and Lance Charge and the 3rd Nastrond in this life will double tap the cloud add

To go even further beyond: delay the Battle Litany and Lance Charge 2 gcds to get an extra Nastrond under these buffs. If the clouds live long enough you can re-enter life for another double tap Nastrond on the cloud right before they feed.



# E11S
If you keep jump properly on cooldown you will have a naked life before sundered sky, and end the phase with 1 eye.



# E12S
## Phase 1
Use High Jump after Wheeling Thrust in the opener to keep it on cooldown through Shiva and Titan.
!faq e12melee for uptime on Shiva.

Battle Litany at 0-4-8 for enrage kills.
Lance Charge can be delayed up to 30 seconds.
Dragon Sight must use on cooldown. Tether bad targets if needed.

For sub-8:10 kill times, you can delay party 2 minute burst until 2:30, meaning Dragon Sight and life for you.

Refer to specific strat for Lions.


## Phase 2
Must be early to land Full Thrust before Darkest Dance kb. 2.49 or faster makes this more consistent. Replacing 1 DHIT meld to 1 SKS meld solves this problem.

Start jumps after Chaos Thrust instead of Fang and Claw to facilitate Spineshatter Dive to gap close perfectly after Darkest Dance.
Move Life Surge to the Wheeling Thrust to keep High Jump on cooldown.

Try to land High Jump before Basic Relativity stun.
Delay 2nd and 4th life (Intermediate Relativity)
Delay Dragon Sight at 2m until after Basic's knockback.

High Jump should be on the first GCD after Intermediate. This gains +1 eye before Advanced Relativity if used on cooldown, which may gain +1 life cycle.

Elusive Jump back to the boss at the end of Cataclysm's cast bar, but be sure you know the proper AoE dance to handle it. You can always maintain uptime if you handle it properly.

After Advanced Relativity, you can pot just before boss returns to fix buffs and cooldowns.

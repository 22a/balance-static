- Is Double True dead?
As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin and True.

:dpsmonky:  - What's with the double DK in the openers? 
With Standard you DK after PB for DK's higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally.
With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.

:dpsmonky:  - What do non opener RoF windows look like? 
Similar to opener, you may not have leaden fist while going into it though.

:dpsmonky:  - Is Twin Snakes meant to drop for a bit?
2 GCDs without twin snakes after each PB window are intended.

:dpsmonky:  - What food is good?
Depends on your stats but the BiS uses Smoked chicken.

:dpsmonky:  - Any recommendations for crafted gear/1st week raiding gear melds?
Crafted Exclusively: https://etro.gg/gearset/ffcd0478-818d-45b2-83e9-7bcef5f75617
Crafted with non-savage stuff dropped in and 1 DH meld to DET: https://etro.gg/gearset/4b5883ff-8b9e-46fc-8fc3-62d255596e6d
If you're considering getting the Emmy weapon/Pants later you may as well flip that one meld on the initial set

:dpsmonky:  - Where can I try out changes to the rotation?
Try the sim found in here: https://discord.gg/M9BYeJN

:dpsmonky:  - Why does the BiS have so many DET melds?
Every time someone asks I add another DET meld to the BiS and therefore only the few people who notice contribute to the problem.

(The real reason is stat tiering.)

:dpsmonky:  - Got a good visualization of the Rotation?

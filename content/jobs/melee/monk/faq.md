> *Is Double True dead?*

As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin and True.


> *What's with the double DK in the openers? *

With Standard you DK after PB for DK's higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally.  
With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.


> *What do non opener RoF windows look like?*

Similar to opener, you may not have leaden fist while going into it though.


> *Is Twin Snakes meant to drop for a bit?*

2 GCDs without twin snakes after each PB window are intended.


> *What food is good?*

Depends on your stats but the BiS uses Smoked chicken.


> *Any recommendations for crafted gear/1st week raiding gear melds?*

Crafted Exclusively: <https://etro.gg/gearset/ffcd0478-818d-45b2-83e9-7bcef5f75617>

Crafted with non-savage stuff dropped in and 1 DH meld to DET: <https://etro.gg/gearset/4b5883ff-8b9e-46fc-8fc3-62d255596e6d>

If you're considering getting the Emmy weapon/Pants later you may as well flip that one meld on the initial set


> *Where can I try out changes to the rotation?*

Try the sim found in here: <https://discord.gg/M9BYeJN>


> *Why does the BiS have so many DET melds?*

Every time someone asks I add another DET meld to the BiS and therefore only the few people who notice contribute to the problem.  
(The real reason is stat tiering.)


> *Got a good visualization of the Rotation?*

This (courtesy of Murasa) which should give you an idea of how it plays out in a vacuum

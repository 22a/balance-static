Section 1

introduction

Hello and welcome to Monkey, I am Perfect Balance and I am going to feed you the information you need to punch and kick at a decent level in the patch of our lord and saviour 5.58. I'm not one for lengthy introductions so let's get to feeding.



Section 2: Basics

Positionals

It's unlikely that you've made the decision to play Monk while remaining unaware of the P word, but in case you've not come across it before, a "positional" is a skill that only gains maximum effect when used at a specific part of an enemies' hitbox, typically flank or rear. All 6 GCD in Monks core single target rotation has a positional effect, so it's important you know which is which.

Bootshine, True Strike, and Demolish all deal maximum damage when executed from behind an enemy.

Dragon Kick, Twin Snakes, and Snap Punch on the other hand are best used from an enemies' flank (side).

This might sound like a lot of movement back and forth from the enemies rear to side and back again, but in reality you can simply stand near the borderline of where the enemy hitbox crosses from side to rear and step back and forth between that line as needed. The image below illustrates which part of the hitbox is classified as flank/rear, and also shows which area to ideally stand for minimal required movement.



Forms

Forms are a concept unique to Monk, and is what seperates it from standard combo based melee jobs. Unlike other jobs that simply have combos that trigger each other in a static manner, you can combo any GCD into any other GCD thanks to your forms. Each GCD also gains a bonus effect when used in the correct form, meaning you want to keep your forms advancing forwards and not break your combo, else you'll drop your form and your damage will suffer.

You have 3 forms; Opo-Opo, Raptor, and Coeurl.



Uptime - both in the normal sense and wrong positional sense

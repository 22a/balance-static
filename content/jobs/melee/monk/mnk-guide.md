## Section 2: Basics

Positionals

It's unlikely that you've made the decision to play Monk while remaining unaware of the P word, but in case you've not come across it before, a "positional" is a skill that only gains maximum effect when used at a specific part of an enemies' hitbox, typically flank or rear. All 6 GCD in Monks core single target rotation has a positional effect, so it's important you know which is which.

Bootshine, True Strike, and Demolish all deal maximum damage when executed from behind an enemy.

Dragon Kick, Twin Snakes, and Snap Punch on the other hand are best used from an enemies' flank (side).

This might sound like a lot of movement back and forth from the enemies rear to side and back again, but in reality you can simply stand near the borderline of where the enemy hitbox crosses from side to rear and step back and forth between that line as needed. The image below illustrates which part of the hitbox is classified as flank/rear, and also indicates which area to ideally stand for minimal required movement.

![](/img/positional-thing.png)

Forms

Forms are a concept unique to Monk, and is what seperates it from standard combo based melee jobs. Unlike other jobs that simply have combos that trigger each other in a static manner, you can combo any GCD into any other GCD - providing that you're progressing your form forward. Each GCD also gains a bonus effect when used in the correct form, meaning you want to keep your forms advancing forwards and not break your combo, else you'll drop your form and your damage will suffer.

You have 3 forms; Opo-Opo, Raptor, and Coeurl.

In Opo-Opo form, Bootshine, Dragon Kick, and Arm of The Destroyer gain additional effects.

In Raptor form, True Strike, Twin Snakes, and Four-point Fury gain additional effects.

In Coeurl form, Demolish, Snap Punch, and Rockbreaker gain additional effects.

Uptime

Uptime is absolutely king, and 99% of the time when people come asking for help as to why they're doing low DPS, it's because they have poor uptime.

Now I mean this in two different senses of the word. First and foremost is what you may be thinking of already when you hear the word "uptime", and that's simply making sure you're in melee range as much as possible so you can continue to hit the boss. It's okay to have poor uptime as you're learning a fight, since you won't know the timings on mechanics or the ranges on certain boss aoes. As time progresses however, you will start to learn these things, and you want to minimise downtime by only running out barely beyond the danger zone on an aoe so that you can get back in quicker, as well as simply running back in quicker once you know that damage has resolved and the aoe is now gone. This is where most people falter; they "respect" aoes too much, they run away too far and for too long.

Second is keeping your GCD rolling in general. Some people will choose to prioritise positionals more than rolling their GCDs, and so will stop hitting the boss for a second or so in order to make sure they're in position to continue hitting. This is really bad and you shouldn't do this. If you're unable to hit a positional, keep your GCD rolling anyway, as the amount of time wasted waiting for the positional to become available will add up to an incredible amount of potential missed GCDs over a fight, which is far more punishing that missing the positional is.

### Section 3: Building the Rotation

Single target GCDs

As previously mentioned, Monk has 6 core single target GCDs.

Bootshine has a potency of 200, or 370 when you have Leaden Fist. When in Opo-Opo form, Bootshine will always crit if executed from the rear of an enemy.

Dragon Kick has a potency of 230, or 260 when executed from the flank. When in Opo-Opo form, it will grant the Leaden Fist buff.

True Strike has a potency of 270, or 300 when executed from the rear. It can only be executed from Raptor form.

Twin Snakes has a potency of 230, or 260 when executed from the flank. It also grants a 10% damage increase buff that lasts for 15 seconds, and can only be executed from Raptor form.

Demolish has a potency of 80, or 110 when executed from the rear. It applies an 18 second duration dot with 80 potency, for a combined total of 110+480 potency. It can only be executed from Coeurl form.

Snap Punch has a potency of 270, or 300 when executed from the flank. It can only be executed from Coeurl form.

Form Shift is a unique GCD, as it's not directly a part of our rotation, but it does enable our rotation. Form Shift grants the Formless Fist buff, which allows you to use any GCD and gain its additional form effects. Since this GCD does no damage, we only ever use it before pulling an enemy or during downtime.

There are a couple of minor things to keep in mind here. First is that at every form you have 2 options for which GCD to use. Second, is that all positionals are worth 30 potency except for Bootshine, where you instead lose the guaranteed crit effect if you miss the positional. Therefore Bootshine is the most important positional to land, as it's potentially the biggest loss.

Opening your inner Chakra

Chakra is Monk's job gauge, which stacks up to 5 times. At 5 stacks of Chakra we can spend them to execute either The Forbidden Chakra, a strong single target oGCD, or Enlightenment, a weaker AoE oGCD.

There are multiple ways that we generate chakra.

First is Meditation, a GCD with a 1 second cooldown that opens a single chakra upon being pressed. When outside of combat it generates 5 stacks of chakra instantly.

We then have 2 traits; Deep Meditation I & II. Deep Meditation I grants an 80% chance of generating a chakra upon landing a critical weaponskill. Deep Meditation II turns that 80% chance into a 100% chance.

Finally we have Brotherhood. Brotherhood has multiple effects, but in this section we'll just talk about the effect pertaining to Chakra generation. Upon execution, party members within 15 yalms will gain the effect of Meditative Brotherhood for 15 seconds. While this buff is active on an ally, every time they execute a weaponskill or a spell there is a 20% chance that you will gain a stack of chakra.

oGCDs

In terms of oGCDs Monk is somewhat simple.

We have 3 buffs:

Riddle of Fire, a 20 second duration buff that increases damage dealt by 25%. It has a 90 second cooldown.

Brotherhood, a 15 second duration buff that applies 2 effects to you and all party members within 15 yalms. The first is a 5% damage increase, the second is Meditative Brotherhood, which helps generate chakra.

Perfect Balance, a buff with a 15 second duration/6 stacks that enables the use of any GCD as if you have its form bonus.

We have 5 damaging oGCDs at our disposal.

Elixir Field, a 30 second cooldown that deals 250 potency to all enemies in a 5 yalm radius around the user.

Tornado Kick, a 45 second cooldown that deals 400 potency to a single target.

Shoulder Tackle, a 30 second cooldown with 2 charges that deals 100 potency to a single target. This is also our gapcloser, and so should be used to traverse long distances quickly as opposed to walking across a room and wasting time.

The Forbidden Chakra, a 1 second cooldown that deals 340 potency to a single target. As previously mentioned, The Forbidden Chakra costs 5 stacks of chakra to use.

Enlightenment, a 1 second cooldown that deals 200 potency to all enemies in a straight line in front of you. Enlightenment also has a cost of 5 chakra.

We never hold any of our oGCDs, you'll notice that every skills cooldown is a multiple of 90; this means that if we press them all exactly when they come back up, they will realign perfectly every time.

Opener

Standard

\[Insert picture of opener here]

Early

\[Insert picture of opener here]

We currently have 2 different openers, the Standard and the Early opener. Generally you're better off using the standard opener, the early opener is better for specific situations based on fight/phase length where you're able to get an additional use of oGCDs, extra time on a buff, or better buff timings for your group.

The reason the openers work the way they do is as follows; Form Shift prepull so we don't have to do a non-form GCD. Leaden Fist is the single most important buff to gain as it grants an additional 170 potency to our guaranteed crit Bootshine, so we want to get that ASAP. Twin Snakes following this because its a 10% damage buff and we want that up as our next priority. Riddle of Fire next because Demolish is our highest potency GCD and by applying it as our first GCD in Riddle of Fire means we can do a 2nd Demolish as our final GCD under the buff. Following Demolish is The Forbidden Chakra so we don't overcap on chakras and waste any potential stacks, as our next Bootshine is a guaranteed crit so would otherwise be wasted. After the Bootshine we use Perfect Balance, which allows us to alternate between Dragon Kick/Bootshine for 6 GCDs. This is simply the most damage efficient way of spending our 6 PB stacks. Once Perfect Balance falls off you should always use Dragon Kick*, reapply Twin Snakes, and finally end with a Demolish.

You'll notice that the Early opener is practically the same, with 2 minor adjustments. First, everything is 1 GCD sooner because we started on Twin Snakes instead of Dragon Kick. Second, as a result of this all of our Opo-Opo GCDs invert, so Bootshines become Dragon Kicks and vice-versa.

\*Reasoning behind this is explained in the FAQs section.

Core Gameplay Loop, including RoFs

Now that we've covered the core GCDs and oGCDs we can piece together what our rotation is going to look like following the opener.

Its effectively a 3 step flowchart, where at each step you make a decision between GCD A or GCD B.

When in Opo-Opo form, you check if you have Leaden Fist active. If you do, use Bootshine, if you don't, use Dragon Kick.

When in Raptor form you check the duration of your Twin Snakes. If its at 9 seconds remaining or more, press True Strike, if less, reapply Twin Snakes.

When in Coeurl form, check the duration of your Demolish. If its' at 2 seconds remaining or less reapply Demolish, else press Snap Punch.

Now on the face of it this might seem really confusing and like you're constantly having to check things, but in reality it's very simple.

You'll notice that when applying this system, the rotation actually falls into a very repetetive pattern. Your Opo-Opo GCDs will always alternate between Bootshine and Dragon Kick. Your Raptor GCDs will always alternate between True Strike and Twin Snakes. Your Coeurl GCDs will always have 2 Snap Punches inbetween every Demolish.

Depending on the opener you used, your ensuing rotation will end up looking like one of the 2 following images;

\[Insert image here]

Now you may wonder what do you do when your buffs come back up, and the answer is thankfully quite simple - you simply redo your opener. Now when I say redo I don't mean \*exactly\* redo it, as you'll notice that your Opo-Opo GCDs have naturally flipped since the opener. This means that if you started the fight with the Standard opener, your first RoF usage will look exactly like the Early opener. If you started with the Early opener, you'll end up doing the Standard opener. This continues to alternate throughout the fight. 

Your Opo-Opo GCDs flipping doesn't just effect your burst though, it also effects your rotation. As a result you'll find that every 90 seconds your rotation flips between the 2 images previously shown. Eventually you will build muscle memory to the point of not having to consciously consider which GCDs to be using when, you will simply press the right buttons at the right time.

Utility/Situational Skills and how to use them

Monk has a number of utility skills that range from very useful to almost entirely useless.

First is Six-Sided Star, a GCD with a potency of 540. It also grants a movement speed buff for 5 seconds, isn't locked to a form, and has no positional. At first glance this move seems very strong and like something you'd want to use frequently, however it's unique in that its GCD is twice as long as any other GCD, 5 seconds at base. Simply put, using 2 GCDs is always better than using 1 SSS, so you will only ever use SSS in scenarios where you \*cannot\* use 2 GCDs. This means before a boss goes invulnerable, as the last GCD before an enemy dies, as the last GCD before you have to disengage from an enemy, or before using a Limit Break.

We then have Anatman, which is basically useless. Anatman is a skill on the GCD, which when used puts you in a channel state that will be broken if you move, use any other skill, or even just turn your character. Upon use your Twin Snakes buff will be refreshed to 15 seconds, and will remain there for the duration of the channel. If this sounds useless its because it is. At its absolute best it will gain you 50~ potency.

True North is one of our best friends. It's a 45 second cooldown with 2 charges, and nullifies positional requirements for 10 seconds. This is incredible for those situations where for whatever reason you're not able to get behind/to the side of an enemy, and will save you a lot of lost damage when used correctly.

Riddle of Earth is effectively a mini True North, with 3 charges and a 30 second cooldown. Upon activation you gain 3 stacks of Riddle of Earth, each of which provides 10% mitigation and nullifies the positional of a single GCD. This should primarily be used for its positional nullification, but in emergencies can be used for its mitigation.

Arms Length is a 120 second cooldown that nullifies knockbacks, it doesn't apply to \*all\* knockbacks but it should cover most of them. Very nice skill to have, as it makes sure you don't get knocked away from the boss so you can keep punching.

We also have a couple of skills that help our friends in the party out, and they're as follows:\
Mantra, a 90 second cooldown that increases healing received by 10% on yourself and anyone nearby at the time you pressed it. Generally best to confer with your healers as to when they want it, but if for whatever reason there's no communication going on there just use it before big aoe damage comes out on the group.

Feint, another 90 second cooldown that lowers the targets strength and dex by 10% for 10 seconds. Useful on enemies that deal physical damage, again its best to ask the tanks or healers when they want you to use this skill, but in general do it for big physical hits. Be careful not to overwrite a Feint another melee dps has already applied.

Bloodbath, another 90 second cooldown. For 20 seconds you'll heal for a portion of your damage dealt, nice if your healer is struggling or if you took some single target damage.

Second Wind, a 120 second cooldown that instantly heals you for 500 potency. See description of Bloodbath.

How to Effect Areas

Now that we've covered how Monk works and its single target rotation, how to AoE will hopefully be much easier to understand.

Monk actually has a third GCD option on each of its forms, these are our AoE GCDs.

Opo-Opo form has Arm of the Destroyer, a circle AoE around you with a 110 potency, or 140 with form bonus.

Raptor form has Four-point Fury, another circle AoE around you with a 140 potency which also extendes Twin Snakes by 10 seconds.

Coeurl form has Rockbreaker, \*another\* circle AoE around you with 150 potency.

To AoE, you start by applying Twin Snakes and then simply begin using your AoE gcds instead of single target, based on the amount of enemies.

At 2 targets, you continue to alternate Bootshine and Dragon Kick. Four-Point Fury replaces Twin Snakes but you'll still use True Strike when Twin Snakes doesn't need extending. You apply Demolish to both enemies (provided they will live long enough for it to tick), and Rockbreaker will replace Snap Punch.

At 3 targets, Arm of the Destroyer replaces Dragon Kick/Bootshine, Four-point Fury replaces True Strike, but you'll still be rotating Demolishes between each enemy, again providing they will live long enough for it to tick.

At 4+ enemies you shift to entirely using only your 3 AoE GCDs.

#### Section 4

FAQ

"RoF is coming up too early in my rotation, what do?"

This likely means your GCD is too fast, and should naturally fix itself when you reach the desired GCD threshold of 1.96. In the meantime, you can fix this by doing an additional uncomboed Dragon Kick following a previous Dragon Kick. This will slow you down by 1 GCD and should realign RoF with Demolish.

"Why are there 2 Dragon Kicks in the opener?"\
"Why don't I get Leaden Fist after using PB?"

So these are kind of the same question with more or less the same answer. You may have noticed that after Perfect Balance we don't have any form, so we \*have\* to do a single GCD without form. We always want this formless GCD to be a Dragon Kick, as it's stronger than an uncomboed Bootshine. 

"If I end PB with Leaden Fist, should I not do an uncomboed Bootshine instead?"

No, as this would be a waste of the Leaden Fist proc. You want all of your Bootshines to be guaranteed crits, so you would stick to the rule of "Always DK after PB" to make sure the Leaden isn't eaten by an uncomboed Boot. Remember, we're not 'wasting'/'overcapping' on Leaden stacks here as the DK is uncomboed.

"Twin Snakes falls off in my opener, is that normal?"\
Yep, Twin Snakes will fall off for a little but during PB.

title: Monk Savage Tips
---

Hello, it’s PB here, and welcome to the Monk doc for Eden’s Promise. 
 
In the following, I’ll be collating advice that is generally specific for Monk, but in some places (regarding uptime), may be applicable to other melee DPS too. Alongside examples, clips and videos will be provided where applicable to help you see how to execute certain things.


Good luck, hope this helps.  

I also have YouTube and Twitch channels, if you feel like checking them out

## Opener

In Cloud, generally the early buff opener is the better option. This is to help in hitting all 7 party members with Brotherhood before they run away to Narnia to deal with Anti-Air/wide angle. It’ll also help if you have a very fast kill time (6:30 or faster) as the boss will die during your RoF window, so you want to ensure you get the maximum amount of RoF buffed GCDs off during the fight.

## Anti-Air/Wide Angle
Anti-air and wide-angle can both be done with full uptime. I have linked a video I created explaining how to do this, as well as a timestamped run demonstrating dodging into the centre before stacking (ignore the Sam soulstone)..

# Shadowkeeper

Honestly, not a lot to talk about for this one.


## Opener
Standard opener here. 
Make sure you have a Shoulder Tackle available to dash back in after he does his big stupid circle AoE when he stands up.


## Shadow Cleave
Not really Monk specific, but make sure your group is doing a nice uptime strat that lets you hit positionals as it happens during RoF. Also make sure you actually hit everyone with BH, as it comes up midway through this mechanic.


## Knockback
Make sure the group is close to you and all are using their anti-knockback for your 3rd Brotherhood, to ensure all 7 party members get it.


## Shadow Warrior
So again, not Monk specific but I thought I’d include here that you can do this mechanic without disconnecting from the boss if your group mitigates it properly. 
[This tweet](https://twitter.com/FFXIVMomo/status/1347781157769850881?s=19) from Momo shows you what it looks like and how you’d position.
If you’re not in a group willing to do this, then you’re gonna just have to learn how late you can afford to stay for, and save a Shoulder Tackle to get back to the boss asap afterwards.


Yeah there’s really nothing Monk specific of note in this fight, just be sure to have a tackle ready each time he stands up and does his AoE.



# Fatebreaker


## Opener
You want to do early buff opener in this fight, as well as swap EF and TK so that you use TK first.
This is because if you use the standard opener you lose a full use of TK in phase 1.
If you use the standard opener with TK first instead of EF you’re fine, but if you get Lightning Burnt strike second pattern you have to disconnect as TK comes up, thus delaying it and losing you the use again. As a result, Early buff TK first is the only way to safely guarantee no missed uses.


## Phase 1
This phase is basically mindless uptime outside of Lightning Burnt Strike. You can keep full uptime if you sprint beforehand, save a tackle after, and time your GCD, but it is undoubtedly difficult. Personally I find lightning first pattern to line up better with 1.96 GCD, but it’ll depend slightly on when exactly you start casting from the pull, if you clip etc. As such all I’ll say is to [count your GCDs and learn your limit for when you need to disengage.](https://youtu.be/kgJyvJdNRhc)  

Also worth mentioning is that Brotherhood will be coming up during second Burnt Strike, it’s worth letting your team know this so that they stay close to you instead of dodging to the opposite side of the room and not getting Brotherhood.
Make sure to end the phase with an SSS right before the boss leaves.


## Downtime 1
You can use Anatman here to keep Twin Snakes up so that your first 2 GCDs in the reopener have Twin on. Amazing skill thanks Yoship.


## Phase 2
Nothing special here. Standard reopener, pray that the second Burnt Strike you get in this phase is either Holy or Fire.
Holy is ideal, as it means you can save Arm’s Length to make the following downtime a lot easier, [however you *can* choose to save a Shoulder Tackle for this instead in case you get Fire but want to save Arm’s Length.](https://youtu.be/kgJyvJdNRhc?t=16)
Again, make sure to end the phase with an SSS.


## Phase 3
Early buff reopener here. Generally I’m not talking much about CD alignment in this doc because that’s a group/kill time specific thing to figure out for yourself, however a lot of people ask questions about this so I’ll touch on it briefly.  
You’ll notice that RoF comes up just before Prismatic, and so you might be wondering “Should I hold it or use it and only get half a use?”  
This depends on your kill time.  


![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458951851610734595/888146745475887134/unknown.png)

As you can see, using RoF before Prismatic will gain you an extra use if the boss dies close to the enrage at 11:20. However, if you kill the boss quicker, at 10:50, you get the same amount of uses, in which case holding is better as you get a more effective RoF use. However, if we kill it even faster, at 10:30 or quicker, we’re losing a use by holding RoF, and then again with a very fast kill time of sub 9:30 we don’t lose a use by holding.

For those instances where you can’t afford to hold RoF and need to use it before Prismatic, the Early Buff opener allows you to get more GCDs in that 2nd RoF before the boss disappears.  
I’m aware a lot of people are playing in PF without an easily predictable kill time, and so for that reason I’d recommend you generally use it on CD instead of holding, as this will afford you an extra use at the end of the fight, which will be helpful if the group is at risk of hitting enrage.  

Mandatory: Make sure your last GCD in this phase is an SSS.  

Following this there’s nothing to optimise, just do cycles and don’t die.  





# The Door

Again, not a lot to write about this boss, it’s basically a 6-8 minute long dummy.


## Opener
Either is fine here. Some choose to do Early opener so that the BH during Titan Junction is more likely to hit the rest of the group.
Alternatively, standard opener with a BH/FBC weave after Demo accomplishes the same thing.


## Shiva Junction
You can keep full uptime on this mechanic, if you position yourself such that you are slightly behind the boss on the side opposite of where you will slide too. From there, you want to slide out to the edge of the safe zone, where you will still be in melee range, before using Shoulder Tackle to dodge the aoe that appears under you.  
[Video](https://youtu.be/y1SHzUE277g)


After this, pray you’re tethered to a tether far away enough that you can stay in melee range the whole time.


## Titan Junction
Don’t miss people with Brotherhood 4head.


## Palm of Temperance
The knockback following the Rock Dudes shooting 4 lasers knocks you back incredibly slowly so you can stay in melee range the entire time and simply Shoulder Tackle to cancel the knockback. This gives you uptime, and makes hitting positionals a lot easier here.


## Lions
Only 2 things of note here.
1. Do an uptime strat.
2. Never* use RoF during Lions.
* Using RoF during lions sucks because you’ll lose positionals, and depending on the strat you will possibly lose RoF GCDs too. Holding RoF till 6:30 (after lions are done) is almost never going to cost you a use, and it means it’ll come off CD at 8 minutes which will line up with any 1/2 minute raid buffs your group has.
The asterisk exists of course, because if you’re killing the boss in 6:45 or shorter, holding RoF means you’re going to lose RoF GCDs. So there’s your asterisk, never use RoF in Lions unless you’re killing it insanely quickly.



# Big Head

 
# Opener
Do Standard.


# Basic Relativity
Do a good strat so you can keep full uptime.


# Intermediate Relativity
Not Monk specific, but try and persuade your group to do the Unreal Uptime strat

# Cataclysm
[Video for full uptime](https://youtu.be/78cI2ns9SFI)


# Dual Cataclysm
You can delay your buff window here from 4:30 to 5:00 to secure full uptime and ensure you hit everybody with BH and it’ll be back in time for the reopener.
You can hold TK into this delayed RoF window, and provided you weave it early you’ll get a second use off before she disappears for Advanced Relativity.



That’s it, that’s literally everything about Monk worth mentioning for this boss.

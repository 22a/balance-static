## Single target GCDs

Monk has six core single-target GCDs.

|                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000208.png) | Bootshine has a potency of 200, or 370 when you have Leaden Fist. When in Opo-Opo form, Bootshine will always crit if executed from the rear of an enemy.                                                                                                                                                                |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002528.png) | Dragon Kick has a potency of 230, or 260 when executed from the flank. When in Opo-Opo form, it will grant the Leaden Fist buff.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000209.png) | True Strike has a potency of 270, or 300 when executed from the rear. It can only be executed from Raptor form.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000213.png) | Twin Snakes has a potency of 230, or 260 when executed from the flank. It also grants a 10% damage increase buff that lasts for 15 seconds, and can only be executed from Raptor form.                                                                                                                                   |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000204.png) | Demolish has a potency of 80, or 110 when executed from the rear. It applies an 18 second duration dot with 80 potency, for a combined total of 110+480 potency. It can only be executed from Coeurl form.                                                                                                               |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000210.png) | Snap Punch has a potency of 270, or 300 when executed from the flank. It can only be executed from Coeurl form.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002536.png) | Form Shift is a unique GCD, as it's not directly a part of our rotation, but it does enable our rotation. Form Shift grants the Formless Fist buff, which allows you to use any GCD and gain its additional form effects. Since this GCD does no damage, we only ever use it before pulling an enemy or during downtime. |

There are a couple of minor things to keep in mind here. First is that at every form you have 2 options for which GCD to use. Second, is that all positionals are worth 30 potency except for Bootshine, where you instead lose the guaranteed crit effect if you miss the positional. Therefore Bootshine is the most important positional to land, as it's potentially the biggest loss.


## Opening your inner Chakra

Chakra is Monk's job gauge, which stacks up to five times. At 5 stacks of Chakra, we can spend them to execute either The Forbidden Chakra, a strong single target oGCD, or Enlightenment, a weaker AoE oGCD.

There are multiple ways that we generate chakra.

|                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002534.png)                                                                         | First is Meditation, a GCD with a 1 second cooldown that opens a single chakra upon being pressed. When outside of combat it generates 5 stacks of chakra instantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ![](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/w/images/thumb/7/73/Deep_Meditation_II_Icon.png/48px-Deep_Meditation_II_Icon.png) | We then have two traits; Deep Meditation I & II. Deep Meditation I grants an 80% chance of generating a chakra upon landing a critical weaponskill. Deep Meditation II turns that 80% chance into a 100% chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002542.png)                                                                         | Finally we have Brotherhood. Brotherhood has multiple effects, but in this section we'll just talk about the effect pertaining to Chakra generation. Upon execution, party members within 15 yalms will gain the effect of Meditative Brotherhood for 15 seconds. While this buff is active on an ally, every time they execute a weaponskill or a spell there is a 20% chance that you will gain a stack of chakra. |


## oGCDs

In terms of oGCDs Monk is somewhat simple.

We have 3 buffs:

| Icon                                        | Name            | Cooldown | Duration       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002541.png) | Riddle of Fire  | 90s      | 20s            | increases damage dealt by 25%.                                                                                                                                        |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002542.png) | Brotherhood     | 90s      | 15s            | applies 2 effects to you and all party members within 15 yalms. The first is a 5% damage increase. The second is Meditative Brotherhood, which helps generate chakra. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000217.png) | Perfect Balance | 90s      | 10s / 6 stacks | enables the use of any GCD as if you have its form bonus.                                                                                                             |

We have 5 damaging oGCDs at our disposal.

| Icon                                        | Name                 | Cooldown | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002533.png) | Elixir Field         | 30s      | deals 250 potency to all enemies in a 5 yalm radius around the user.                                                                                                                             |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002531.png) | Tornado Kick         | 45s      | deals 400 potency to a single target.                                                                                                                                                            |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002526.png) | Shoulder Tackle      | 30s      | deals 100 potency to a single target, with 2 charges. This is also our gapcloser, and so should be used to traverse long distances quickly as opposed to walking across a room and wasting time. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002535.png) | The Forbidden Chakra | 1s       | deals 340 potency to a single target. As previously mentioned, The Forbidden Chakra costs 5 stacks of chakra to use.                                                                             |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002545.png) | Enlightenment        | 1s       | deals 200 potency to all enemies in a straight line in front of you. Enlightenment also has a cost of 5 chakra.                                                                                  |

We never hold any of our oGCDs. You'll notice that every skills cooldown is a multiple of 90; this means that if we press them all exactly when they come back up, they will realign perfectly every time.



## Utility/Situational Skills and How To Use Them

Monk has a number of utility skills that range from very useful to almost entirely useless.

|                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002547.png) | First is Six-Sided Star, a GCD with a potency of 540. It also grants a movement speed buff for five seconds, isn't locked to a form, and has no positional. At first glance, this move seems very strong and like something you'd want to use frequently, however it's unique in that its GCD is twice as long as any other GCD, 5 seconds at base. Simply put, using 2 GCDs is always better than using one SSS, so you will only ever use SSS in scenarios where you *cannot* use 2 GCDs. This means before a boss goes invulnerable, as the last GCD before an enemy dies, as the last GCD before you have to disengage from an enemy, or before using a Limit Break. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002546.png) | We then have Anatman, which is basically useless. Anatman is a skill on the GCD, which when used puts you in a channel state that will be broken if you move, use any other skill, or even just turn your character. Upon use, your Twin Snakes buff will be refreshed to 15 seconds, and will remain there for the duration of the channel. If this sounds useless, it's because it is. At its absolute best, it will gain you 50~ potency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000830.png) | True North is one of our best friends. It's a 45 second cooldown with two charges, and nullifies positional requirements for ten seconds. This is incredible for those situations where, for whatever reason, you're not able to get behind/to the side of an enemy, and will save you a lot of lost damage when used correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002537.png) | Riddle of Earth is effectively a mini True North, with three charges and a 30 second cooldown. Upon activation, you gain three stacks of Riddle of Earth, each of which provides 10% mitigation and nullifies the positional of a single GCD. This should primarily be used for its positional nullification, but in emergencies can be used for its mitigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000822.png) | Arms Length is a 120 second cooldown that nullifies knockbacks, it doesn't apply to *all* knockbacks, but it should cover most of them. Very nice skill to have, as it makes sure you don't get knocked away from the boss so you can keep punching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

We also have a couple of skills that help our friends in the party out, and they're as follows:\

|                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000216.png) | Mantra, a 90 second cooldown that increases healing received by 10% on yourself and anyone nearby at the time you pressed it. Generally best to confer with your healers as to when they want it, but if for whatever reason there's no communication going on there, just use it before big AoE damage comes out on the group.                         |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000828.png) | Feint, another 90 second cooldown that lowers the targets strength and dexterity by 10% for ten seconds. Useful on enemies that deal physical damage, but again, it's best to ask the tanks or healers when they want you to use this skill. In general, do it for big physical hits. Be careful not to overwrite a Feint another melee DPS has already applied. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000823.png) | Bloodbath, another 90 second cooldown. For 20 seconds, you'll heal for a portion of your damage dealt. This is nice if your healer is struggling, or if you took some single target damage.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000821.png) | Second Wind, a 120 second cooldown that instantly heals you for 500 potency. See description of Bloodbath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## How to Effect Areas



Monk has a third GCD option on each of its forms -- these are our AoE GCDs.

|                                             |                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000215.png) | Opo-Opo form has Arm of the Destroyer, a circle AoE around you with a 110 potency, or 140 with form bonus.                       |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002544.png) | Raptor form has Four-point Fury, another circle AoE around you with a 140 potency which also extendes Twin Snakes by 10 seconds. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002529.png) | Coeurl form has Rockbreaker, *another* circle AoE around you with 150 potency.                                                   |

## Major Mechanics

### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign all players a clock spot. In addition, assign each melee and ranged a number from one to four. These will be used to soak towers later into the fight.

Place ABCD markers at the cardinal edges of the arena.

### Mechanic Overview

### Akanthai Mechanics

The fight is split into several Akanthai Acts. Each Act is preceded by Hesperos showing what mechanic will be cast with thorns on the arena. He will tether to thorns with **Wreath of Thorns**, showing the order of the mechanics cast. Thorns can represent towers, tethers to players, or large explosions. Players can also be tethered to other players. Tethers are broken based on proximity.

**Hemitheos's Fire IV**

This thorn will be a large semi-circular AoE on the outside of the arena.

**Hemitheos's Thunder III**

This thorn will be a tower that players have to soak, dealing moderate damage and inflicting a Lightning Resistance Down debuff and a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.

**Hemitheos's Fire III***

Two players will be tethered together with a fire (red) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, both players will take AoE damage that must be shared by two other players. All players damaged will receive a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.

**Hemitheos's Aero III**

Two players with be tethered together with a air (teal) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, both players will instantly die. If allowed to time out, both players will dodge this instant kill.

**Hemitheos's Dark IV***

One player will be tethered to a thorn with a dark (purple) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, all players will take heavy magic damage and be inflicted with a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.

**Hemitheos's Water III**

One player will be tethered to a thorn with a water (blue) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, there will be an AoE around the player that deals moderate damage and inflicts a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff. In addition, this will trigger the tethered thorn's **Hemitheos's Thunder III**.

**Hemitheos's Water IV***

This thorn will knockback from the centre of the arena.

### Akanthai Acts

An AoE tank buster on two targets chosen by promixity to the boss.
* **Nearsight** will target the two closest players. The two tanks should be inside the boss's hitbox and all other players should be max melee range or further.
* **Farsight** will target the two furthest players. The two tanks should be outside the boss's hitbox at max melee range and all other players should be in the centre of the boss's hitbox.

**Demigod's Double**

A devastating tank buster on the main tank in an AoE around them. This must be shared with the off tank and mitigated, or invulned by themselves.

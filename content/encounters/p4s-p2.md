## Major Mechanics

### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign all players a clock spot. Assign two light parties of one tank, one healer, and two DPS each. In addition, assign each melee/tank and ranged/healer a number from one to four. These will be used to soak towers later into the fight.

Place markers on the arena as such.

### Akanthai Mechanics

The fight is split into several Akanthai Acts. Each Act is preceded by Hesperos showing what mechanic will be cast with thorns on the arena. He will tether to thorns with **Wreath of Thorns**, showing the order of the mechanics cast. Thorns can represent towers, tethers to players, or large explosions. Players can also be tethered to other players. Tethers are broken based on distance.

**Hemitheos's Fire IV**

This thorn will be a large semi-circular AoE on the outside of the arena.

**Hemitheos's Thunder III**

This thorn will be a tower that players have to soak, dealing moderate damage and inflicting a Lightning Resistance Down debuff and a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.

**Hemitheos's Fire III***

Two players will be tethered together with a fire (red) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, both players will take AoE damage that must be shared by two other players. All players damaged will receive a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.

**Hemitheos's Aero III**

Two players with be tethered together with a air (teal) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, both players will instantly die. If allowed to time out, both players will dodge this instant kill.

**Hemitheos's Dark IV***

One player will be tethered to a thorn with a dark (purple) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, all players will take heavy magic damage and be inflicted with a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff. In addition, this will trigger the tethered thorn's **Hemitheos's Thunder III** if applicable.

**Hemitheos's Water III**

One player will be tethered to a thorn with a water (blue) symbol on top. When this tether is broken, there will be an AoE around the player that deals moderate damage and inflicts a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff. In addition, this will trigger the tethered thorn's **Hemitheos's Thunder III**.

**Hemitheos's Water IV***

This thorn will knockback from the centre of the arena.

### Akanthai Acts

**Akanthai: Act 1**

Act 1 has two Fire IV thorns north and south, two Fire IV thorns east and west, and eight Thunder IV thorns at intercardinals in and out.

**Akanthai: Act 2**

Act 2 has two Fire IV thorns north and south, two Fire IV thorns east and west, and four Thunder IV thorns at cardinal edges, though all of these are slightly offset. In addition, one tank or one healer will be tethered with Dark IV, a healer and a tank will be tethered with Fire III, two DPS will be tethered with Fire III, and two DPS will be tethered with Aero III.

**Akanthai: Act 3**

Act 3 has four Thunder IV thorns on one edge east or west, four Thunder IV thorns on one edge on the opposite side, and one Water IV thorn in the middle of the arena.

**Akanthai: Act 4**

Act 4 has four Thunder IV thorns at either cardinal or intercardinal edges and four Fire IV thorns at either intercardinal or cardinal edges. Four players will be tethered to the Thunder IV thorns with Water III, while four players will be tethered to the Fire IV thorns with Dark IV.

**Akanthai: Finale**

The Finale has eight Thunder IV thorns around the middle of the arena in a circle. In addition, there will be two thorns at opposite intercardinal edges which tethers four players of a role (tank/healer or DPS) with Aero III.

**Akanthai: Curtain Call**

The Curtain Call has eight Dark IV thorns at cardinal and intercardinal edges that tether to one player each.

### General Mechanics

**Searing Stream**

A heavy raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Dark Design**

AoEs will appear on the ground under all players. Bait these together and dodge.

**Ultimate Impulse**

A catastrophic raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Nearsight** and **Farsight**

An AoE tank buster on two targets chosen by promixity to the boss.

* **Nearsight** will target the two closest players. The two tanks should be inside the boss's hitbox and all other players should be max melee range or further.
* **Farsight** will target the two furthest players. The two tanks should be outside the boss's hitbox at max melee range and all other players should be in the centre of the boss's hitbox.

**Demigod's Double**

A devastating tank buster on the main tank in an AoE around them. This must be shared with the off tank and mitigated, or invulned by themselves.

**Heart Stake**

A heavy tank buster on the two players with the highest enmity. This will inflict an uncleansable bleed DoT for 15 seconds.

**Kothornos Kick**

Hesperos jumps to the furthest player, knocking back all other players that are caught in the radius. This deals moderate magic damage to the player jumped to and inflicts a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.

**Kothornos Quake**

Hesperos will shoot three unmarked conal AoEs at the closest three players, dealing light damage and inflicting a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.

**Hell's Sting**

Hesperos will shoot marked conal AoEs. After this ability is cast, he will shoot unmarked conal AoEs into the areas he did not before. Move into the marked conal AoEs to dodge. Getting hit will deal moderate damage and inflict a ~42% damage down debuff.

## Fight Strategy

### Akanthai: Act 1

* The fight starts off with a heavy hitting AoE, so pre-shield and mitigate.
* Players can generally ignore the actual cast of the Akanthai mechanic, and instead base their positioning when the boss casts Wreath of Thorns.
* For the first Act, players need to dodge two large AoE explosions at north/south or east/west, each soak a tower, and then move into the final safe spot at east/west or north/south. [Here is a Toolbox Diagram](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=299547078671461&preview=1) explaining how to do the mechanic.
* Look at which thorns Wreath of Thorns tethers to first. If Hesperos tethers to north and south, players will be starting east and west. If Hesperos tethers to east and west, players will be starting north and south. Light party 1 should go north, and light party 2 should go south.
  * First, dodge the explosions - max melee range is safe.
  * Next, each player needs to go soak their pre-assigned towers. Healers and ranged DPS will be getting the outer four, and tanks and melee DPS will be getting the inner four. Tanks and healers go clockwise, DPS go counterclockwise.
  * Finally, move to the safe spot by rotating further to east/west or north/south.
* Immediately after, tanks will need to do Farsight or Nearsight. All other players should be either inside the boss's hitbox or outside the boss's hitbox to ensure they are not hit.

### Ability Order

Akanthai: Act 1
Searing Stream
Wreath of Thorns
Farsight OR Nearsight
```

### Akanthai: Act 2

* Hesperos will then show Act 2's mechanics.
* This is followed by Demigod Double. It is highly recommended to have the MT invuln this.
* The boss will then tether to two Fire IV thorns and two Thunder III thorns, and the the other two Fire IV thorns and two Thunder III thorns. Players will have to start either north/south or east/west based on which Fire IV thorns were not tethered first, just like Act 1. If Hesperos tethers to north and south, players will be starting east and west. If Hesperos tethers to east and west, players will be starting north and south.
  * Look north. There will be two thorns at the edge - if the left thorn is tethered, players are going north and south, and if the right thorn is tethered, players are going east and west.
* Players will receive tethers as the castbar finishes. Players will move to a specific position based on what tether they have. [Here is a Toolbox Diagram](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=110645221771461&preview=1) explaining how to do the mechanic.
  * Tanks will always go south or east. The tank with fire will go between the numbered marker and the boss to bait Dark Design, and the tank with dark or nothing will go to the wall counterclockwise of the left thorn to bait Dark Design.
  * Healers will always go north or west. The healer with fire will go between the numbered marker and the boss to bait Dark Design, and the healer with dark or nothing will go to the wall counterclockwise of the left thorn to bait Dark Design.
  * The two DPS with air will go north or west and go between the numbered marker and the boss to bait Dark Design.
  * The two DPS with fire will go south or east and go between the numbered marker and the boss to bait Dark Design.
* The boss will then cast Dark Design, AoEs under each player. Bait these where specified, and immediately after move to the correct position.
  * The healer with dark or nothing will go to the tower at the wall on the lettered number, but ensure you are not hit by the Fire IV.
  * The tank with dark or nothing will go to the tower at the wall on the lettered number, but ensure you are not hit by the Fire IV.
  * The tank with fire and two DPS with fire will go to the numbered marker at their spot.
  * The DPS with air and the healer with fire will also go to the numbered marker at their spot.
* After Fire IV blows up and players take damage, return to the middle for heals and once healed head immediately towards your final positions.
  * The healer with dark or nothing rotates clockwise and soaks the tower at that location.
  * The tank with dark or nothing rotates clockwise and soaks the tower at that location.
  * The healer with fire rotates counterclockwise and heads to the numbered marker at that location.
  * The tank with fire rotates clockwise and heads to the numbered marker at that location.
  * The two DPS with air rotates clockwise together to the numbered marker at that location.
  * One DPS with fire needs rotate clockwise and one DPS will fire needs to rotate counterclockwise. Both will head to the numbered marker at their location.
* After the second Fire IV sets blow up, head to the middle and heal up for Ultimate Impulse. This needs 2 10%s and shields to survive.

### Ability Order

```
Akanthai: Act 2
Demigod Double
Wreath of Thorns
Dark Design
Ultimate Impulse
```

### Akanthai: Act 3

* After Ultimate Impulse, Hesperos will begin Act 3.
* Act 3 is much simpler than the other Acts. There are two ways to do this mechanic - either have ranged do all towers and melee do all jumps and quakes, or have each role do one set of mechanics each. [Here is a Toolbox Diagram](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=290644693971461&preview=1) explaning how to do the latter.
* As Wreath of Thorns is casting, note which side of thorns he tethers to first, either east or west. All players should start on that side of the boss, inside the boss's hitbox.
* Afterwards, the boss will cast Kothornos Kick. The main tank needs to bait this to the opposite side of the arena.
* Immediately after, the two melee and the offtank should head towards the boss, while the main tank who baited the jump runs behind the boss at max melee range. The two melee and offtank need to stand inside the boss's hitbox: one in front, one on the left flank, and one on the right flank. This is to bait Kothornos Quake.
* At the same time, the ranged DPS and healers need to soak towers at the edge of the arena. Soak them from north to south in the order assigned.
* All players need to press their knockback immunity when they soak towers or take a Kothornos Quake.
* From here, the strategy diverges based on whether your group wants to have ranged or melee soak second towers.
  * If melee are soaking second towers, simply have the four melee stay on that side and soak their towers from north to south in the order specified.
  * One healer should bait Kothornos Kick while the other three players move towards the other side to ensure they are not hit.
  * Finally, the healer baiting moves through to the middle and the other three players bait Kothornos Quake inside the boss's hitbox.
  * If you want to have ranged also take the second set of towers, have all four ranged run across the arena directly opposite to a tower.
  * The tank baiting will run across the arena to bait the kick. The other three will gap close across and bait the quake.
* After this mechanic resolves, players need to do Nearsight or Farsight. Heal up the tanks and mitigate.
* Move the boss middle and point him north. At this point if the offtank is not second in enmity they will need to provoke the boss.
* Heart Stake needs to be heavily mitigated and healed through, and targets first and second in aggro.

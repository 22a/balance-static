### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign the raid into two light party stacks with one tank, one healer, and two DPS each. Place the markers as such.

### Mechanic Overview

**Murky Depths**

A moderate raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Doubled Impact**

A physical tank buster on the current main tank that needs to be shared by both tanks or invulned.

**Sewage Deluge**

A heavy raidwide AoE that deals magic damage. Floods the arena, making the entire arena except for the raised platforms and drained areas inflict a Dropsy DoT to players who stand in the water. In addition, one of the raised platforms will begin to overflow with water, killing any player who stands on it.

**Spoken Cataract** and **Winged Cataract**

The head and body of the Hippokampos will do a cleave and a line AoE respectively. The body will always do a line AoE, but the head will do a wide AoE in front if it is Spoken Cataract and a wide AoE behind it if it is Winged Cataract.

**Coherence**

The Hippokampos will tether to a random player. When the castbar ends, the head will jump to the tethered player dealing heavy damage, and the body will do a line stack AoE on a random healer. The tether should be taken by a tank and mitigated, and a tank needs to stand in front of the party as the first player in the stack relative to the boss will take extra damage.

**Ominous Bubbling**

A delayed stack marker on both healers that deals water magic damage inflicts a Water Resistance down debuff, meaning players cannot get hit by more than one.

**Shockwave**

The Hippokampos will jump to a random safe raised platform and do a knockback from the centre of that platform. This deals minimal magic damage and knockback immunities do work on it.

**Predatory Avarice**

Inflicts a random tank and random DPS with Mark of the Tides and a random healer with Mark of the Depths.
* When Mark of the Tides expires, the player will pulse a large AoE that knocks back players in the radius.
* When Mark of the Depths expires, the player will pulse a large AoE that deals magic damage to all players in the radius.

**Channeling Flow**

Inflicts all players with Mark of the Tides, which is indicated by an arrow pointing to a cardinal direction. When this debuff expires, players will get pushed in the indicated direction, and must collide with another player with an arrow of the opposite direction. They will receive also receive a Water Resistance down debuff and be stunned. There will always be one tank, one healer, and two DPS with unique directions.

**Channeling Overflow**

Inflicts all players with Mark of the Tides, but there are two sets with different durations.

**Tainted Flood**

Marks a tank, a healer, and two DPS with an AoE marker that deals moderate magic damage and inflicts a Water Resistance down debuff. The marked players will be the ones that are not doing Channeling Overflow's Mark of the Tides at the time.

When the arena is not flooded, all players will be marked with the AoE marker at the same time.

**Kampeos Harma**

Marks all players with one to four blue or purple dots. Players marked with blue dots will be dashed to by the body of the Hippokampos in sequence from one to four, and players marked with purple dots will be jumped to by the head of the Hippokampos in sequence from one to four.

**Dissociation**

The head of the Hippokampos will separate from its body and appear at the edge of the arena. It will do a divebomb down the side of the arena it appears on.

**Sewage Eruption**

Three sets of AoE markers appear under all players. Bait these and move together as a group.

## Major Mechanics

### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign all players a partner of the opposite role and range - two tanks with two ranged DPS, and two healers with two melee DPS. Assign each of these groups a numbered marker from one to four. Split these groups into two light parties of one tank, one healer, and two DPS each for the adds phase and Fountain of Fire - a north/east light party and a south/west light party.

Place markers on the arena as such.

### Mechanic Overview

**Scorched Exaltation**

A heavy raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Heat of Condemnation**

Two tethers appear on random non-tanks. These tethers must be picked up by tanks and brought far apart at the front of the boss, as they do a magical tank buster in a large AoE when the castbar resolves.

**Experimental Fireplume**

The boss will cast either eight small orbs or one large orb when the castbar finishes.
* Eight small orbs: AoEs will appear at opposite cardinals and rotate around the arena before hitting the centre. Move out to the second AoE to dodge this.
* One large orb: A gigantic AoE will be baited on a random player. All players bait this in the middle of the arena and move to the edge of the arena.

**Left Cinderwing** and **Right Cinderwing**

The boss will cleave the left side or right side of the arena relative to where it is facing. This will inflict a damage down to any players hit.

**Darkened Fire**

Spawns a Darkened Fire add under tanks/healers or DPS that has a damage taken reduced buff. If they are too close to each other they will tether and explode. These start casting Darkened Blaze as they spawn, and must be killed before it is allowed to finish. Players should stand with their partner at their marker to bait these.

**Brightened Fire**

Marks each player with an AoE and a number from one to eight. The Phoinix will breathe fire on each player sequentially, dealing light damage and inflicting a fire resistance down debuff for a few seconds. If a Darkened Fire add is hit by four Brightened Fire AoEs, it will remove the buff that they have preventing them from taking damage.

**Devouring Brand**

A line of fire appears at cardinals and slowly moves towards the centre, leaving intercardinal quadrants safe.

**Searing Breeze**

AoE markers appear under all players. Bait together and move to dodge.

**Trail of Condemnation**

The boss will become untargetable and jump to an edge of the arena. Either its middle head or its two side heads will glow.
* If the middle head is glowing, it will do a line AoE across the centre of the arena and all players will get marked for an AoE. Spread these out to the sides.
* If the side heads are glowing, it will do a line AoE across the sides of the arena and all players of a role will get marked for a shared AoE. Stand in the centre line and stack with a partner.

**Sunbird**

Four Sunbird adds will spawn during Phase 2. These must be picked up by tanks. These will pulse a large AoE when being revived, and if any Sunbird corpse is in it the boss will receive a damage up buff that will eventually wipe the raid.

**Flames of Undeath**

A massive raidwide AoE that deals magic damage. It will revive all dead Sunbirds and make them grow larger. Revived Sunbirds will retain the enmity table they had before they were killed. If large Sunbirds were revived, they will turn into Sparkfledged and attach to the boss.

**Fireglide Sweep**

Each revived Sunbird will tether to a tank, healer, and two DPS. Those players in turn will be tethered to a player who does not have a tether of the opposite role. When the castbar resolves, the Sunbird will dash to the tethered player and then the subsequent tethered player, dealing proximity physical damage and inflicting a Blunt Resistance Down debuff. 

**Dead Rebirth**

A catastrophic raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Fledgling Flight**

Marks all tanks and healers or all DPS with a Sparkfledged pointing towards a cardinal direction. These will spawn on their location and emit a large conal AoE in the indicated direction.

**Experimental Gloryplume**

The boss will do an **Experimental Fireplume** mechanic, then summon eight small dark orbs or one large dark orb.
* Eight small dark orbs: all players are marked with an AoE, so spread after Fireplume.
* One large dark orb: One tank and one healer will be marked with a stack marker, so stack after Fireplume.

**Fountain of Fire**

Spawns two sets of three fountains starting from the north/south or east/west of the arena and going clockwise. These fountains must be soaked by a player, and inflicts the player standing inside with Trickle of Fire, which massively boosts healing potency for six seconds.

**Sun's Pinion**

Marks the two closest players to the boss with an AoE marker. This deals moderate magic damage and inflicts a Fire Resistance down debuff. This AoE will drop a Sunbird Pinion on the player, which will do a proximity tether to them, then dash to them after a while.

**Firestorms of Asphodelos**

A catastrophic raidwide AoE that deals magic damage. This will summon burning rain once more, and spawn fire tornados North, Southwest, and Southeast on the arena.

## Fight Strategy

### Phase 1

* The fight begins with a raidwide AoE into a tank buster.
* For Heat of Condemnation, the offtank should stand in the centre, pick up a tether, and move out immediately. The main tank is then able to find the other tether, pick it up, and run back north. All other players should be at max melee range or further.
* The first real mechanic is Experimental Fireplume. Players should all stack in the direct centre square of the arena. If it is rotating AoEs, move out to the second one, and if it is one large AoE, move to the edge.
* Immediately after, the boss will start casting Left Cinderwing or Right Cinderwing from the centre. Orient yourself properly and dodge this.
* Return to the centre and stack with your assigned partner on your assigned number (tanks and healers with DPS, 1-2-3-4) to bait Darkened Fire. Once these have spawned, spread out.
* To remove the invincibility from Darkened Fire adds, they need to be hit by four instances of a Brightened Fire AoE. To do this, each Brightened Fire needs to hit two orbs each time.
  * This can be easily achieved by having each Brightened Fire number stand at ABCD markers, hitting two adds each. 1 and 5 should stand at A, 2 and 6 should stand at B, 3 and 7 should stand at C, 4 and 8 should stand at D.
  * While players can stand in the middle and move to the marker when it is their turn, it is simpler to have both players stack at the location and mitigate the hits, as two hits is not lethal.
  * Once an add has been hit four times, players should quickly destroy the adds.
* Do another Heat of Condemnation and Scorched Exaltation. Stack in the middle afterwards to bait Experimental Fireplume.
* For this Fireplume, players should all head to 1 or 2 as a group no matter what it is. This is to bait Searing Breeze and Left/Right Cinderwing. Stack at the edge of the arena and move in.
* Another Heat of Condemnation follows this, so position properly.
* Do a final Experimental Fireplume and the boss will disappear and do Trail of Condemnation. Don't move into the middle too early.
* For Trail of Condemnation, treat where the boss appears as relative north. Each player should position with their partner in a line down the arena from there, so the 1 marked group would be directly in front, and 4 would be all the way opposite.
  * If it is a line AoE down the centre, the tanks and melee should move left out of the AoE and the healers and ranged should move right out of the AoE, satisfying the spread mechanic.
  * If it is a line AoE down the sides, simply stay stacked with your partner in the middle column.
* Heal up and get ready for adds phase.

### Phase 2

* In the entirety of the adds phase, a storm will sweep through, pouring burning rain. This will pulse light raidwide damage periodically.
* Split up into light parties (ranged can generally stay in the middle, but hit your adds). The tanks should pick up the north and south adds, and the north tank should provoke the east add and the south tank should provoke the west add. Kill the north and south adds first, and then rotate clockwise to east and west and kill those adds there.
* Immediately after, return to the centre to heal for Flames of Undeath. These will revive the Sunbirds.
* To perform Fireglide Sweep, each player should note if they are tethered to a player, or tethered to an add and a player. [Here is a Toolbox Diagram](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=464441775941461&preview=1) showing how Fireglide Sweep is done.
  * The player tethered to the add and another player needs to go directly across the said Sunbird and be on the left side (clockwise) of the add.
  * The player tethered to only another player needs to directly across their tethered player once they have positioned themselves opposite of their Sunbird and be on the right side (counterclockwise) of the add.
  * Once the Sunbird does its first dash, the player that it dashed to needs to move behind it or beside it to dodge the second dash, or they will be clipped.
  * The Sunbird will dash again.
* After the dashes, heal up. Tanks should go back north and south and their adds will naturally go back to them. Kill one add again, rotate, and kill the other add. After the final Sunbird has been killed, return to the middle, heal, and mitigate the second Flames of Undeath. Heal and mitigate for Dead Rebirth, but there is plenty of time to do so.

### Phase 3

* Starting from Phase 3 and onwards, the player second on the enmity list will take four autoattacks from the Sparkfledged periodically when they are not doing a mechanic. The offtank should retain this position at all times.
* Nothing changes about Heat of Condemnation, but the offtank will be taking more damage and likely needs to be spot healed for each one.
* Fledgling Flight will target all tanks/healers or all DPS. Simply stand on the ABCD markers, pointing the arrow towards the outside of the arena. Move to the centre afterwards.
* All players should then stay in the middle to bait Experimental Gloryplume. Do not move out from the centre until both abilities have been confirmed.
* The first fire orbs will show whether it is rotating AoEs or a baited AoE. The second dark orbs will show whether it is light party stack or spread.
* Tanks and melee should go north, into the space from the D marker to the 2 marker. Healers and ranged should go south, into the space from the B marker to the 4 marker.
* Immediately after, spread from each other if it is spread, or stack in the melee/ranged groups if it is stack.
* Fountain of Fire is the next mechanic in the fight. It requires precise positioning from each player to bait mechanics and perform them. Here is a Toolbox Diagram showing how Fountain of Fire is done.
  * All players except for the tanks should be outside of the boss, and the tanks should be direct centre to bait Sun's Pinions.
  * Note where the first fountains spawn. The first light party's healer should get the north and east fountains, and the second light party's healer should get the south and west fountains. The healer's job is simple: they will soak each fountain in a clockwise pattern. They can use the Trickle of Fire buff to massively heal both themselves and the party between each fountain soak, which deals heavy damage.
* The rest of the party will be baiting AoEs and dashes. AoEs appear sequentially on the two closest players who have not yet received an AoE.
  * These will be baited tanks > melee > ranged. Once the previous set of players receive an AoE marker, the next set of players should move slightly closer to bait the next set. They need to then place their pinion directly in front of the fountain about to explode, then move across the arena behind the opposing pinion.
  * The tanks, once they receive the AoE, should move directly in front of their light party healer's fountain - directly on top of the marker is fine. Once the pinion appears, go directly across the arena and behind the opposing tank's pinion.
  * The melee should then move closer to bait the second set of AoEs. After they receive the marker, place it directly in front of the second fountain. Wait for the tank's pinion to dash across the arena, then go directly across the arena and behind the opposing melee's pinion (max melee is fine).
  * The ranged should then automatically receive the third set of AoEs. Again, place it in front of the third fountain, wait for the melee pinion, then go directly across and behind.

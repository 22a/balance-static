#### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign all players clock spots with melee on intercardinals, tanks north and south, and healers east and west. Markers should be placed as such.

#### Mechanic Overview

**Heavy Hand**

A physical tank buster on the current main tank.

**Warder's Wrath**

A moderate raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Gaoler's Flail**

Erichthonios will bring out two weapons in succession during the castbar. Mechanics will be executed after the castbar ends based on what weapons are used.
* Sickles: A large 270 degree cleave on the side of the arena the sickle was on. Move to the opposite side to dodge. Can either be left or right.
* Morningstar: A point-blank AoE around Erichthonios. Max melee range is safe.
* Chakram: A donut AoE around Erichthonios. 

**Pitiless Flail of Grace** and **Pitiless Flail of Purgatory**

The current main tank will be marked with a line buster. This will knock them back, deal moderate damage, and inflict a magic vulnerability debuff. There needs to be a tank swap during the cast, as the boss will do a mechanic afterwards on whoever has aggro.
* Grace is a stack marker on the tank - all players should stack behind the boss.
* Purgatory is a flare marker on the tank - the tank should run far away from both the other tank and the party.

**Aetherial Shackles**

Marks a random player with a red chain debuff - Shackles of Loneliness - and a purple chain debuff - Shackles of Companionship.
* When Shackles of Loneliness resolves, the player will gain the Inescapable Loneliness debuff. When Inescapable Loneliness resolves, the three furthest players from that player will emit a large AoE around them which deals moderate magic damage and applies a magic vulnerability debuff, meaning players cannot be hit by more than one.
* When Shackles of Companionship resolves, the player will gain the Inescapable Companionship debuff. When Inescapable Companionship resolves, the three closest players from that player will emit a small AoE around them which deals moderate magic damage and applies a magic vulnerability debuff, meaning players cannot be hit by more than one.

**Intemperance**

Erichthonios divides the arena into nine sections with three Spell crystals each. These crystals will explode on a regular interval, inflicting players standing on them with Hot Spell (fire), Cold Spell (ice), and Disastrous Spell (purple).
* Hot Spell and Cold Spell will deal minimal damage if the player has the opposite element or no element, but will deal massive damage and inflict a damage down debuff if they have the same element debuff. 
* Disastrous Spell will instantly kill the player.

In addition, if no one is on a section with Hot Spell or Cold Spell, all players will take damage and receive a damage down debuff.

**Intemperate Torment**

Erichthonios commands the crystals to start exploding.

**Shining Cells**

A heavy raidwide AoE that deals magic damage. Changes the arena to a circle, with different coloured areas.

**Aetherflail**

Erichthonios will do

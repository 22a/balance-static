### Drops

As this is a door boss, there is no loot acquired from this phase.

## Major Mechanics

### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign all players a clock spot and a partner. Assign two light parties of one tank, one healer, and two DPS each.

Place markers on the arena as such.

### Mechanic Overview

**Decollation**

A heavy raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Elegant Evisceration**

A tank buster on the current main tank that deals heavy magic damage in an AoE. After hitting the first time, it will hit a second time. Tank swap during the cast or use an invuln.

**Bloodrake**

One of the major mechanics of the fight. Hesperos will charge his blade and tether to the stage, four players of a role, or all eight players. This will do heavy magic damage to all players tethered and he will gain the Aethersucker buff. This indicates the role that cannot take certain mechanics he will perform next - either tanks and healers (support), or DPS.

**Aetheric Chlamys**

Hesperos charges his sword, converting the Aethersucker buff gained from Bloodrake to a Role Call buff indicating players who can take a subsequent mechanic.

**Director's Belone**

Inflicts four random players with the Role Call debuff and consumes the boss's Aethersucker buff. When this debuff expires, the player will die if they matched the role that was taken by Bloodrake, but will not have any effect if they are of the opposite role.

**Inversive Chlamys**

Tethers four random players which deals moderate damage in an AoE around them when the castbar resolves. However, if the player matches the role absorbed from Role Call, they will die.

**Setting the Scene**

Changes the scene to form four areas - Levinstrike (lightning), Acid (poison), Well (water), and Lava (fire). Each of these will do a mechanic when triggered, as well as deal damage in their quadrant.
* Levinstrike Mekhane: deals proximity damage from the centre of the arena. 
* Well Mekhane: knocks back players from the centre of the arena.
* Acid Mekhane: An unmarked AoE on all players.
* Lava Mekhane: An unmarked AoE on both healers, which must be shared with other players.

**Pinax**

Begins to trigger the stage's Mekhane mechanics in order of which they pulse.

**Shift**

Hesperos will jump to a cardinal direction and his sword or cloak will glow. The direction will be indicated by the ability name: either **Northerly Shift**, **Easterly Shift**, **Southerly Shift**, or **Westerly Shift**.
* If the sword is glowing, he will cleave the middle of the arena from where he jumps.
* If the cloak is glowing, he will knock back all players from where he jumps.

**Vengeful Belone**

Inflicts all players with an Acting Role debuff, which can only be removed by soaking two orbs of the indicated role.
* Two DPS will be inflicted with Acting Healer.
* Two DPS will be inflicted with Acting Tank.
* Both healers and both tanks will be inflicted with Acting DPS.

**Elemental Belone**

Inflicts all players with Elemental Resistance Down, which make them take extra damage from elemental quadrants absorbed by Bloodrake.

**Belone Bursts**

Hesperos summons eight orbs at the edge of the arena. These will tether to the closest player and indicate the Acting Role that needs to soak them, which deals heavy damage. In addition, they need to be soaked by two players at a time, or else it will deal lethal damage.

**Periaktoi**

All elemental quadrants explode, dealing damage. Players must stand on the quadrant not tethered by a previous Bloodrake in order to take non-lethal damage due to the debuff inflicted by Elemental Belone.

**Belone Coils**

Places four towers at the intercardinals of the arena. These must be soaked, but cannot be soaked by the role indicated on the tower.

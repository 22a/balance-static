<p>For level 70 Ultimates, a full set of synced gear with Critical Hit + Determination and enough pieces with Critical Hit + Skill Speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 418 or higher will max out both substats in UCoB. Gear from the Swallow&rsquo;s Compass dungeon and +2 Eureka armor matches the item level sync and may provide a small boost. The last and second-to-last steps of your Bozjan Resistance weapon can be configured to cap out all four substats in UCoB and will provide a very significant boost. The maximum sync value for weapons is 280 in each substat.</p>
<p>Use the most current food available. Any grade Tincture of Strength will grant the maximum benefit in UCoB.</p>
<p>If you wish to further optimize your gear, a non-exhaustive list of best-in-slot configurations using Resistance Weapons will be listed below. You can find a complete list in the dedicated <a href=https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/>best-in-slot guide for DRK</a>, or use the Tank DPS Calculator to determine your own.</p>

<p>Ultimate progression is a team effort. Unlike Savage, incoming damage is so high that GCD healing is not always avoidable. Because of this, how well you perform your job of mitigating for yourself, your co-tank, and your group will directly affect the performance of your healers. The Blackest Night (TBN) in particular is an incredibly strong tool, and smart usage will make a world of difference for your healers. Each phase will include notes on particularly heavy periods of damage on specific party members where TBN will likely be the most useful, but it&rsquo;s ultimately up to your group&rsquo;s healers to communicate where their resources are strained. Remember, it&rsquo;s a win for your party if you can make room for an extra Stone, Broil or Malefic at the cost of shifting an Edge or Flood out of buffs.</p>

<p>Optimizing your damage on Dark Knight revolves heavily around shifting potency into raid buffs, and Ultimates are no different. For best results, coordinate with your group to know when burst windows are occurring. Generally speaking, you will want to pool resources for the start of each phase, with additional burst windows according to the length of the specific section and your party&rsquo;s progress against enrage.</p>
<p>Note that it is impossible to provide a full map of each burst window because killtimes can vary wildly and your party will need to decide how to approach each phase. The following sections will provide guidelines on the more common options, but practicing and consulting with your group is the only way to know for sure.</p>
<h2 id=phase-by-phase-optimization>Phase-by-Phase Optimization<a href=#phase-by-phase-optimization class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<h3 id=phase-one-twintania>Phase One: Twintania<a href=#phase-one-twintania class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>Use your preferred level 80 opener, with a few minor adjustments. First is the obvious omission of Living Shadow. Second is an early use of a defensive cooldown to cover the first Death Sentence if you are pulling. Third is a killtime-dependent shifting of Delirium; with fast pushes, your fourth use is likely to get cut off by Nael&rsquo;s divebombs. It is worth pushing Delirium earlier in your opener to address this.</p>
<p>TBN should be used liberally to help with auto-attack and tankbuster damage. TBN is especially effective for Plummets because a tank who survives Death Sentence with any amount of HP will not need immediate attention. Do still use it for Death Sentences if required. Note that the boss will continue attacking while firing off Liquid Hells, leading to long strings of autoattacks.</p>
<p>The third tank swap will not have Shirk available, so remember to toggle your stance off if you are holding the boss before that point.</p>
<p>Your group may opt to hold 120-second cooldowns at the end of the phase. If they choose to do so, remind them to hold them slightly at the start of Phase Two to align with 60-second cooldowns. Very fast killtimes will negate this issue by ending the phase before 60-second cooldowns can even be used.</p>
<h3 id=phase-two-nael>Phase Two: Nael<a href=#phase-two-nael class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>TBN can again be used very effectively in this phase, especially for quotes involving Thermionic Beam stacks. Dark Mind can be helpful as well.</p>
<p>Your second use of Delirium will likely run up against divebombs. Request that you be allowed to hold the boss there, as the main tank cannot be targeted for them. If your co-tank is a Warrior, let them hold the boss and simply hope you are not targeted.</p>
<h3 id=phase-three-bahamut>Phase Three: Bahamut<a href=#phase-three-bahamut class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>Dark Knight has an excellent suite of defensive cooldowns and can hold Bahamut for the majority of the phase with little issue, but you may opt to swap more frequently. At the very least, you should look to take both sets of triple Flare Breaths due to Dark Mind.</p>
<p>My own cooldown rotation for Bahamut is as follows:</p>
<p>- First uptime phase (Flare Breath -> Flatten): Ensure you survive the Flare Breath with Dark Mind + TBN and then Living Dead for Flatten.</p>
<p>- Post-Quickmarch Trio (Tempest Wing tether -> Flare Breath -> Flatten): Rampart + TBN as the individual Megaflare AoEs go out, and then TBN again for the Flatten. Rampart can cover all significant tank damage if timed well.</p>
<p>- Post-Blackfire Trio (3x Flare Breath): Shadow Wall during the Gigaflare cast, and then Dark Mind as the cast finishes. Apply TBN before or during the Flare Breaths.</p>
<p>- Post-Fellruin Trio (Tempest Wing tether -> Flare Breath -> Flatten -> Flare Breath): Rampart + TBN as you are taking your tether. Rampart will just be coming off cooldown. You can take this set of busters if needed with another TBN use to cover the Flatten, but your co-tank will have more mitigation available and should ideally swap or Cover.</p>
<p>- Post-Heavensfall Trio (3x Flare Breath): Dark Mind + Shadow Wall + TBN, just like the first triple flares.</p>
<p>- Post-Tenstrike Trio (Flatten- > Flare Breath): Rampart as the Gigaflare cast finishes, add TBN for the Flatten, and Dark Mind as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Your first priority for Reprisal is the Gigaflare casts, but with good coordination you can cover most of the tankbusters as well. Ask for Feint on the Flatten casts, as they hurt quite a bit.</p>
<p>Most parties will simply use their offensive cooldowns as they become available during the phase, but you may opt to delay burst until after Quickmarch Trio for better alignment. This is the latest you can use a Tincture and have it available for the start of Phase Four.</p>
<p>All abilities with cooldowns longer than 60 seconds should be held after Tenstrike Trio. Damage to Bahamut still counts for your parse after pushing him below 60% HP, but otherwise serves no practical purpose except resource generation.</p>
<p>Most groups will want to use Tank LB3 for Grand Octet if it is available. Cast it as the towers appear and you will be able to move in time to dodge Twisters.</p>
<p>You will gain about 3600 mana between Bahamut going untargetable for the last time and Nael/Twin becoming targetable. Try to enter Phase Four with full or nearly-full mana.</p>
<h3 id=phase-four-teraflareadds>Phase Four: Teraflare/Adds<a href=#phase-four-teraflareadds class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>You can use a Tincture in the opener here and it will be back up for the final burst during Phase Five.</p>
<p>Throughout the phase, Flood of Darkness will generally be more efficient than Edge of Darkness. Switch over to Edge of Darkness if one boss is nearing death while the other still needs some time to kill. Continue using Souleater combos instead of switching to Unleash, and use Bloodspiller instead of Quietus to spend your gauge.</p>
<p>There are three sets of tankbusters during the phase, though the first set includes only the mini-busters that follow up the main busters in the other two sets. Each set should be mitigated with TBN and Reprisal. This is sufficient for the first set if Rampart and Shadow Wall are not available, but they should be used for the others. Ask for a Feint as well if this is the case.</p>
<p>Tank damage is extremely heavy in this phase. Use TBN liberally, and take special care to shield whichever tank is holding Twintania during each quote, especially if the quote involves a Thermionic Beam stack. Dark Mind is helpful for these quotes as well.</p>
<p>Dump all of your resources before the end of the phase; the transition will &ldquo;kill&rdquo; you and you will start Phase 5 with full mana and zero blood regardless.</p>
<h3 id=phase-five-golden-bahamut>Phase Five: Golden Bahamut<a href=#phase-five-golden-bahamut class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>The first Akh Morn is not especially scary, and you can hold a cooldown here to use for auto-attacks instead.</p>
<p>Discuss your cooldown map with your healers and your co-tank. Most groups will look to invuln either the first and third or the second and third Akh Morns. I prefer the latter option, as it frees up more cooldowns to use for auto-attacks.</p>
<p>TBN is, once again, extremely valuable in this phase. Golden Bahamut will attack five times in a row after each Exaflare cast and can randomly crit for over a third of a tank&rsquo;s max HP, so it is vital to apply any mitigation you can.</p>
<p>Be ready to LB if there is any uncertainty at all for an upcoming Akh Morn or Morn Afah. This can singlehandedly save a run, and most groups will save LB for that purpose as the DPS requirement is very easy to meet in Shadowbringers.</p>
<p>Coordinate your burst windows with your group. Many groups will simply use all cooldowns at the start of the phase, but a more optimized team will fire everything only once resources are built and Tinctures are available again for those who used them during the previous phase.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged at the number on your FFLogs page after clearing. UCoB rankings in particular favor long, messy kills that spend as much time as possible on Phases Four and Five to take advantage of two-target cleave and the Phoenix Blessing buff. An unimpressive number by itself doesn&rsquo;t indicate serious errors in your own play.</p>

<p>Your opener should be similar to the level 80 opener with a few key adjustments. The main considerations are a very early Plunge, delayed Blood Weapon due to lack of Living Shadow, and delayed Abyssal Drain and Salted Earth to take advantage of plumes. An example MT opener is listed below:</p>
<p><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887985754687565855/893323507570704494/unknown.png alt></p>
<p>Plunge pulling is recommended, but Unmend, and facepull openers are also viable. The most important consideration is which one best allows both you and your fellow melee players to keep your GCDs rolling, as Garuda&rsquo;s small size and rapid movement can easily eat your inputs. Consider as well whether you gain a use of Plunge overall, versus holding it for raidbuffs. The Rampart and Salted Earth uses are timed so that they will be active while Plumes are out and expire before Garuda jumps away.</p>
<p>The very early Plunge use allows a second use before Garuda jumps away after the first set of Plumes. This then allows the third use to occur before she jumps away after Frictions, which in turn allows you to Plunge back onto the boss after blocking one of the double Mistral Songs.</p>
<p>Holding Delirium for Plumes is not recommended. While this will naturally align with both sets of Plumes, the extra AoE damage is typically not needed and comes at a cost of damage on the boss. You may even choose to cut out the Quietus from the example opener, as it may not be needed.</p>
<p>If you are not pulling Garuda, using Dark Mind to mitigate the Mistral Song will allow you to cover both hits from the Spiny Plume with Rampart+ Shadow Wall. Combined with Abyssal Drain&rsquo;s multi-target healing, this will considerably ease the healing burden. Your second use of Abyssal Drain can then be held until the second set of Plumes, and the third to hit Ifrit and both front Nails.</p>
<p>Plan your Reprisal uses with your co-tank. Ideally, one tank should cover the Friction casts, and the other should hit the following Aerial Blast.</p>
<p>The second set of Plumes come with quite a bit of damage on the main tank, so make sure to give them a shield with The Blackest Night (TBN) if you are not holding the boss.</p>
<p>You should ensure that you get a second use of Delirium during the phase. If your killtime is too fast to allow a full use at the end, move your first use earlier in your opener.</p>
<h3 id=phase-two-ifrit>Phase Two: Ifrit<a href=#phase-two-ifrit class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>It is possible to keep your combo rolling from Garuda&rsquo;s death to Ifrit&rsquo;s reappearance. However, this is a <em>very</em> tight window, so only try it if you&rsquo;re confident.</p>
<p>Discuss with your group whether you are making an effort to skip the dashes near the end of the phase or not. This means holding your Tincture plus any major cooldowns.</p>
<p>If you are holding the boss during the Nail phase, you can hit three targets with Flood of Darkness by targeting one Nail and moving onto the hitbox of the other.</p>
<p>Nail phase is another period of heavy tank damage, so make sure the tank holding the boss gets a TBN. Use a defensive cooldown as well if you are holding Ifrit. Ideally, the tank with aggro during and after Nail phase should avoid pulling Titan so that they can freely use their cooldowns during Ifrit. TBN is also valuable for Flaming Crush + auto-attack damage.</p>
<h3 id=phase-three-titan>Phase Three: Titan<a href=#phase-three-titan class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>If Plunge is off cooldown when Titan first becomes targetable, you can use it immediately and have it available after the Upheaval knockback. Otherwise, hold it in the opener for that purpose.</p>
<p>Titan&rsquo;s Mountain Buster is one of the hardest-hitting tankbusters in the game, relative to max HP. Do not allow your co-tank to take it without your TBN on them.</p>
<p>Fast killtimes can play havoc with your Delirium windows. You may be forced to push them into awkward times, such as at Upheaval or Magitek Bits, where you will lose hits to avoid losing an entire use. For very fast killtimes, losing that use will be unavoidable and you should aim to align your group&rsquo;s buffs into one burst window.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be shy about dumping your mana before the phase ends. You will be able to generate nearly a full bar before Ultima is targetable.</p>
<h3 id=intermission>Intermission<a href=#intermission class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>Delirium can be used on the Magitek Bits and be available for Ultima opener. This doesn&rsquo;t do anything except make your parse better.</p>
<p>Blood Weapon can be used on Lahabrea. You should get five or six GCDs on Lahabrea, depending on how quickly your melee uses LB.</p>
<p>Make sure that you are the one who uses tank LB, as it looks the coolest.</p>
<p>Bank a Dark Arts proc by using TBN before Ultima hits. This is not incompatible with using the LB3.</p>
<h3 id=phase-4-ultima>Phase 4: Ultima<a href=#phase-4-ultima class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>General buff timings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>60s cooldowns at opener, post-Predation, Annihilation, Aetheric Boom, and enrage</li>
<li>90s cooldowns at opener, Annihilation, Aetheric Boom, and enrage</li>
<li>Tinctures at opener and enrage</li>
</ul>
<p>Example reopener here:</p>
<p><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583964695266983944/891049026160574535/tmp3.png alt></p>
<p>This opener assumes 100 blood and full mana plus a Dark Arts proc.</p>
<p>Note that while this plan involves breaking a combo, there is actually no less from doing so; there are exactly four non-Bloodspiller GCDs in this uptime phase, so a Hard Slash with no followup will be present however things are arranged.</p>
<p>Rampart and your Tincture can be used before Ultima. Shadow Wall can also be used prepull, but the timing is rather tight.</p>
<p>Be careful about your usage of Reprisal on Tank Purges, as it can inhibit LB generation and cause you to miss having LB3 post-Suppression.</p>
<p>Post-Predation is a good time to use defensive cooldowns, as Ultima will do a long string of attacks.</p>
<p>TBN by itself is sufficient for the Mistral Song damage during Suppression. Because you are guaranteed not to get the Gaol, you can aid prog by banking blood and mana to dump into it.</p>
<p>Decide with your co-tank who is using which tank LB at Aetheric Boom; if you are using the LB1, you will need to use Delirium immediately once Ultima is targetable.</p>
<p>Tank damage during primal roulette is very heavy, as Ultima will attack uninterrupted while multiple sources of damage pile on. You may opt to save Rampart at Aetheric Boom to use here. Either way, Dark Mind should be available for the second or third primal. Make sure the main tank gets a TBN as each primal&rsquo;s raidwide goes out.</p>
<p>The main tank cannot be targeted by an Eruption during primal roulette, so don&rsquo;t be shy about standing where you need to to allow for melee positionals.</p>
<p>Watch Ultima&rsquo;s HP; regardless of when your final burst is planned, you should use your Tincture by the time the boss drops to around 15% HP to benefit from its full duration.</p>

<p>For TEA, no gear yet exists that will cap out both substats when synced down to the cap of i475. Because synced gear loses the benefit of affixed materia, it is usually (not not universally) worse than i470/475 options available for a given slot. Gear from The Hero&rsquo;s Gauntlet matches the item level sync and may provide a decent boost. The last- and second-to-last steps of your Bozjan Resistance weapon are special in having finely configurable stats, and will beat out any alternatives if allocated properly.</p>
<p>Use the most current consumables available. You must use Grade 4 Tinctures of Strength for maximum benefit.</p>
<p>If you wish to further optimize your gear, a non-exhaustive list of best-in-slot configurations using Resistance Weapons will be listed below. You can find a complete list in the <a href=https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/>dedicated best-in-slot guide for DRK</a>, or use the Tank DPS Calculator to determine your own.</p>

<p>Ultimate progression is a team effort. Unlike savage, incoming damage is so high that GCD healing is not always avoidable. Because of this, how well you perform your job of mitigating for yourself, your co-tank, and your group will directly affect the performance of your healers. The Blackest Night (TBN) in particular is an incredibly strong tool, and smart usage will make a world of difference to your healers. Each phase will include notes on particularly heavy periods of damage on specific party members where TBN will likely be the most useful, but it&rsquo;s ultimately up to your group&rsquo;s healers to communicate where their resources are strained. Remember, it&rsquo;s a win for your party if you can make room for an extra Glare, Broil or Malefic at the cost of shifting an Edge or Flood out of buffs.</p>

<p>Optimizing your damage on Dark Knight revolves heavily around shifting potency into raid buffs, and Ultimates are no different. For best results, coordinate with your group to know when burst windows are occurring. Generally speaking, you will want to pool resources for the start of each phase, with additional burst windows according to the length of the specific section and your party&rsquo;s progress against enrage.</p>
<p>Note that it is impossible to provide a full map of each burst window because it depends heavily on comp, killtime, and how your party decides to align their cooldowns. The following phase optimization sections will provide guidelines for how to approach each one, but practicing and consulting with your group is the only way to know for sure.</p>
<p>A special word on Delirium: TEA has particularly bad phasing for 90-second cooldowns that only intensifies as you start beating enrages by comfortable margins. When to hold or not hold Delirium is one of the most common, and most difficult, questions asked about playing Dark Knight in TEA. The answer, unfortunately, depends not only on your exact killtime but your exact party composition as well.</p>

<p>Example MT opener:</p>
<p><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/749367375769370684/844640656705323058/tmp3.png alt></p>
<p>Rampart should be used about seven seconds pre-pull in order to be available for the Drainage tethers later on.</p>
<p>Note the position of Abyssal Drain and Living Shadow; Abyssal is held for two-target cleave plus additional healing, and Living Shadow is used after the 4th GCD in order to delay its Quietus to cleave both bosses.</p>
<p>You can opt to pull with Unmend instead. If you do so, replace the last two hits of the Souleater combo with a Stalwart Soul combo. You will also need to use prepull Blood Weapon, as weaving Edge->Blood Weapon after Unmend without clipping is not feasible. The use of a spell with fixed 2.50-second recast time makes this Blood Weapon window somewhat tighter, but it is still consistently doable.</p>
<p>Briefly taking aggro on both bosses to use invulns on a double Fluid Swing plus additional auto-attacks has very high value. With fast killtimes, using invulns in such a way may cause you to be unable to use them in Phase 3, but the tradeoff is almost always worth it. If invulning the first set, you can Arm&rsquo;s Length the baited conal AoE at the cost of not having it available for Limit Cut.</p>
<p>Note that if you do use Living Dead for a set of Fluid Swings, you will probably need to use TBN on yourself directly afterward because Hand of Pain ignores invulnerability.</p>
<p>TBN has great value in this phase in general. Starting after the first double Fluid Swing, it can be chained on cooldown to cover, in order, auto-attacks while moving back to center, the second double Fluid Swing, auto-attacks plus Protean damage on the hand tank, and the Drainage tethers.</p>
<p>Shadow Wall can be used directly after the first Hand of Pain and last through the second Fluid Swing.</p>
<p>The fixed 2.50-second recast time on your AoE combo makes getting full value from Blood Weapon difficult. The best way to deal with this is to hold it until you reach 100 blood and then do the following rotation:</p>
<p>Unleash -> Blood Weapon -> Bloodspiller- > Bloodspiller -> Stalwart Soul -> Bloodspiller -> Unleash</p>
<p>This sequence only waits on the 2.50 recast time once while Blood Weapon is active and should be consistently doable. This should happen as the Drainage tethers go out if you got all five hits of your first Blood Weapon, or earlier if you didn&rsquo;t. You can also opt to hold Blood Weapon for your second Delirium if killtime permits.</p>
<p>You will gain about 2400 mana from passive generation between Living Liquid hitting zero HP and Brute Justice/Bruise Chaser becoming targetable, so make sure not to end the phase at full mana.</p>
<h3 id=phase-two-bruise-chasercruise-justice>Phase Two: Bruise Chaser/Cruise Justice<a href=#phase-two-bruise-chasercruise-justice class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>Decide who is tanking which boss.</p>
<p>Buffs should go out very early in the phase, so you can precast Living Shadow to take full advantage of them. Use after Cruise Chaser disappears to catch buffs after the first GCD, or as Brute Justice&rsquo;s textbox appears for buffs after the 2nd GCD.</p>
<p>TBN should again be used liberally in this phase. Long strings of auto-attacks, lightning passes, and raidwides plus auto-attacks will all quickly break your shield and potentially save resources from your healers.</p>
<p>Rampart can be used after the Spin Crusher cast finishes to cover a string of auto-attacks, mines, ice, and a lightning pass. This is also a good spot to TBN.</p>
<p>Dark Missionary is surprisingly difficult to find good times for, as the party will often be spread about the arena for various mechanics. Good spots to look at are at Missile Command to cover mines + second water pass, or shortly after Plasma Shield to cover Whirlwind + third water pass.</p>
<p>You will gain about 1800 mana from passive generation between Phase Two ending and Alexander Prime becoming targetable. TBN can be used on non-tanks who do not have Aggravated Assault (lightning bolt debuff) to avoid overcap.</p>
<h3 id=phase-three-alexander-prime>Phase Three: Alexander Prime<a href=#phase-three-alexander-prime class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3>
<p>Tinctures must be used in the post-Temporal Stasis uptime window to be available for the start of the final phase. Major cooldowns won&rsquo;t be available until the end of Inception Formation if not held at the end of Phase Two, however, so discuss with your group how you want to handle buff alignment. Generally speaking, Phase Three does have a somewhat tighter DPS check and more room for deaths that will cripple a player&rsquo;s damage output without wiping the party outright.</p>
<p>Delirium windows in post-Temporal Stasis and post-Inception Formation uptime phases will be identical; if you get cut off after three hits in the first, you will get cut off after three hits again in the second, with a slim chance for a fourth.</p>
<p>During Inception Formation, you can Plunge onto the True Heart and use Stalwart Soul combos to gain resources. This should not cost a use of Plunge in any uptime phase, and it is possible to finish two full combos for a completely free 1200 mana and 40 Blood. Overall, you will gain about 4800~5400 mana during Inception Formation, depending on how many combos you finish on the True Heart.</p>
<p>Living Shadow should be precast after Inception Formation to fit more hits under buffs. Casting it as Brute Justice lands should put its first hit under buffs cast after the 2nd GCD.</p>
<p>You will gain about 3000 mana from passive regeneration during Wormhole Formation.</p>
<p>Reprisal can be used once the castbar passes the &ldquo;E&rdquo; in &ldquo;Mega Holy&rdquo; after Wormhole Formation to cover both casts.</p>
<p>Salted Earth will tick on both bosses at triple enrage if placed like so:</p>
<p><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887985804306169866/891227571503628308/unknown.png alt></p>
<p>Note how the AoE is centered at the apex of the lighter, curved metal pattern on the floor. AoE combos will also hit both bosses if used in this spot. You can additionally hit both bosses with Flood of Shadow by targeting one and moving into the hitbox of the other. Make sure to summon Living Shadow closer to Brute Justice than Cruise Chaser so it won&rsquo;t jump onto the invulnerable Alexander Prime after Cruise Chaser is killed. Delirium can be held until 120s buffs go out.</p>
<p>You will gain about 4800 mana from passive generation between Alexander Prime hitting 1 HP and Perfect Alexander becoming targetable. TBN can be used on any party member before Divine Judgment snapshots if desired.</p>
<p>Remember to use the tank LB3 because DRK&rsquo;s is the coolest.</p>

<p>General buff timings are:</p>
<p>- 60-second cooldowns at opener, Fate Calibration Alpha (FCA) cast, after first tankbuster, post-Fate Calibration Beta (FCB), and Temporal Prison (enrage sequence).</p>
<p>- 90-second cooldowns at opener, after first tankbuster, post-FCB, and Temporal Prison.</p>
<p>- 120-second cooldowns at opener, after first tankbuster, and second Irresistible Grace.</p>
<p>- 180-second cooldowns and tinctures at opener and second Irresistible Grace.</p>
<p>Note that the second use of 90-second cooldowns like Delirium should be held briefly after FCA to align with 60-second and 120-second cooldowns. The final use will be slightly misaligned with the rest of the burst window, but FCB downtime forces a certain amount of drift regardless. If have a Ninja in your party, they will want to delay the post-FCB Trick Attack to align with the full burst window after Irresistible Grace if you are confident in a faster kill. You should still use your own 60-second cooldowns according to this plan unless you are killing before the third prison even falls. They must still be used immediately after FCB and then again as they come up to avoid losing a use.</p>
<p>Plan your opener around having 8 GCDs before stopping for Ordained Stillness if it comes first. Blood Weapon does not need to be used immediately if you have enough blood banked to summon Living Shadow because Fate Calibration Beta will prevent you from gaining or losing a use regardless. Untarget the boss for Ordained Stillness to prevent autoattacks from triggering it rather than performing the additional action of sheathing your weapon. You can sneak in an extra GCD after Stillness if it comes first, or after The Final Word if Ordained Motion is first.</p>
<p>Discuss with your co-tank and healers how you want to handle the tankbusters in this phase. Two of them should be handled with invulns, and one of them with conventional cooldowns. Regardless of which buster you use Living Dead for, you can use Dark Mind + TBN to survive the first hit and give your healers a slightly longer window to cleanse Walking Dead.</p>
<p>Perfect Alexander does not auto-attack very much except during Almighty Judgment (&ldquo;Exatrines&rdquo;). Ask for a Feint, use a defensive cooldown if available, and give whoever is tanking a TBN because the risk of tank death is high here.</p>
<p>Plan who will take which Temporal Prison during the enrage sequence. Tanks usually take the third and fourth prisons; if you handle your cooldowns well, you should take the fourth prison if you co-tank is a Paladin or Warrior, or the third prison if your co-tank is a Gunbreaker.</p>

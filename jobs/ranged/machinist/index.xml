You can use Hypercharge freely when above 50 heat as long as four conditions are met:
Drill and Air Anchor have more than eight to ten seconds left on cooldown You will not break your combo. (It will break if you try to carry it over HC + Drill + Anchor.) You have 0-1 Gauss Round and Ricochet charges stored.</description></item><item><title>Machinist Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 23:03:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/openers/</guid><description>Openers  It is important that you attempt to put as much damage into the raid buffs of your party as possible. Wildfire does not scale with skill speed, so once it’s placed in your opener it will never move forward and can only be delayed in your rotation. Wildfire should be placed properly in the opener based on your party composition and the downtime you have in an encounter. Wildfire snapshots raid buffs upon use of the ability &amp;ndash; not on detonation.</description></item><item><title>Machinist Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:19:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/basic-guide/</guid><description>Job Overview Machinist is a fast-paced physical ranged job that excels at quick burst damage and has the added benefit of free movement.

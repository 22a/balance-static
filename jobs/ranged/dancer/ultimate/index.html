<p><em>By: Ringabel Dim of Excalibur</em></p>
<p><strong>The Epic of Alexander</strong> is an Ultimate fight added in patch 5.1. For those unfamiliar with Ultimate fights, they are a significant step above Savage tier in difficulty in that they require a high amount of raid coordination along with high performance in all roles (tighter heal checks, tank coordination, and DPS requirements compared to Savage fights). Additionally, the fight is longer (about 17-17.5 minutes expected kill time for first time clearers) and very punishing when it comes to messing up mechanics. Because the fight is iLvl synced to iLvl 475, you cannot brute force the mechanics / DPS checks with gear. There are many nuanced things you will have to learn and how to deal with different variations of mechanics in order to succeed. Ultimate is a serious commitment, expect to wipe many many times and spend many hours / raid days / weeks working on the fight if you want any chance of succeeding. The key to success in Ultimate is consistency and patience.</p>
<p>One difficulty in writing this guide is that there are many different ways to handle the mechanics and various groups of different abilities may choose to handle things differently. This fight requires a lot of teamwork, so it will be important that you and your team work together to determine what works best for your group. The information found in this guide are small tips and tricks that can come in handy as you are approaching the fight as a DNC. There are several important pieces of information that are very dependent on how your group handles the mechanics and raid buffs that make it impossible to write a one size fits all guide. However, hopefully this guide provides useful information you can utilize to help obtain your clear.</p>

<p>Before talking about specific phases though, let’s talk about Dance Partner(s). Because of the fight timings and in some phases the ability to hit multiple targets at the same time, this fight offers opportunities to switch your Dance Partner between phases or during downtime in order to increase the total raid damage contribution you bring. Every raid group is different and the ideal Dance Partner will depend on the different DPS jobs you are playing with, skill level of the player you are partnering, phase specific timings and how they affect different jobs’ ability to do damage, and whether the job has significant gains when able to hit more than one target at the same time.</p>
<p>What I would encourage DNCs to do is to upload wipe logs to <a href=https://www.fflogs.com/>FFLogs</a> to analyze how your party is doing to help figure out who the best person would be to partner at different times of the fight. It doesn’t hurt to experiment on different DPS members in the early phases (especially since the LL and BJCC DPS checks aren’t difficult) to figure out what works best for your group. One thing to keep in mind when doing this analysis is that Devilment contribution to snapshotted DoTs that go beyond the 20 seconds Devilment is up is not observed when just looking at rDPS during those 20 seconds.</p>
<p>In December of 2020, a <a href=http://partnercalc.herokuapp.com/>partner calculator</a> was created to help solve who would be the optimal Dance Partner. I would encourage uploading your group’s logs during progress to see how different Partners would fare as a potential Partner in different phases.</p>
<h1 id=technical-finish-and-devilment-timings>Technical Finish and Devilment Timings<a href=#technical-finish-and-devilment-timings class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1>
<p>Plan this out with your group, ALL 2-minute buffs should be used together, i.e. Chain Stratagem, Divination, Dragon Sight, Embolden, Technical Step, Devilment. Coordinate with your team when the best time to use these buffs would be for your group. Here are the most ideal times:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opener of Living Liquid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opener of Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Gavel in Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser (NOTE: some groups may opt to want to hold buffs for Alexander Prime opener and NOT use buffs here, which will affect subsequent uses of Technical Finish / Devilment for the rest of the fight)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you held buffs during post-Gavel, use during Alexander Prime opener</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you used Technical post-Gavel, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Technical immediately after Alexander Prime returns after Inception Formation (after popping your -15s Standard Finish). This pushes Technical a bit later into trio enrage—it will generally go off around the time Cruise Chaser is about to die—and there is a risk that Technical will not be up for the Perfect Alexander re-opener if your team kills Alexander Prime too quickly.</li>
<li>Start Technical 15 seconds before the boss returns after Inception Formation (start this around the time Cruise Chaser first appears in the middle of the arena). This loses a cast of Standard Step but allows you to get more two-target cleaves under your Technical window during trio enrage, and more importantly, should allow you to re-open properly for Perfect Alexander even if Alexander Prime is killed quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you held buffs during post-Gavel, use at the start of Trio Enrage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you used Technical post-Gavel, use when they come off cooldown during Trio Enrage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on how long it takes your group to kill Alexander Prime and whether your group wants to hold buffs for post Stillness in Final Word will affect when you do the Technical Finish in your Perfect Alexander opener. You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use at very beginning of Perfect Alexander opener (might not be possible if you had to use Technical late into Trio Enrage due to using it post-Gavel)</li>
<li>Wait until Ordained Stillness happens during Final Word</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use when it comes off cooldown (sometime shortly after Fate Calibration Alpha).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use during second Exatrine / Irresistible Grace (NOTE: this means delaying Technical Step by 15-30 seconds in order for it to line up with your final potion).</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that if raid DPS is low enough that clear time is consistently at fifth Jail or later, it may be worth desyncing Flourish from the delayed Technical window and to keep it rolling as you can get another full Flourish at the end.</li>
</ul>

<li>Start of Alexander Prime (One second before you get frozen by Temporal Stasis; NOTE that this will only line up with Technical Step / Devilment if your group does not use TS/DM post-Gavel. This is the only option you have for using a potion during Alexander Prime otherwise you will not be able to use a potion for the Perfect Alexander re-opener).</li>
<li>Start of Perfect Alexander (NOTE: this will only line up with Technical Step / Devilment if your group is using buffs right at the beginning of the phase).</li>
<li>Start of second Exatrine during Perfect Alexander (should line up with final use of Technical Finish / Devilment).</li>

<p>(Special Note about this opener: You may notice top speed run groups’ logs are opening with a pre-stepped Technical Step. The reason these groups are doing this is because they are killing Living Liquid so fast that Technical Step would not otherwise be up for the reopener during BJCC).</p>

<p><em>(Forced clip opener, uses a double weave after Technical Finish to buff the first GCD with Devilment while making sure Liquid Hand has spawned before SS goes off)</em>:<br>
-15 sec Standard Step > two Steps > Peloton > -2 sec Potion > Standard Finish > Technical Step > four Steps > Technical Finish (Flourish, Devilment) > Reverse Cascade > Fountainfall > Saber Dance (if at 60 Esprit, otherwise Rising Windmill) > Standard Step > two Steps > Standard Finish (FD3) > &mldr;</p>
<p>Liquid hand spawns <em>precisely</em> at the 20 second mark of the fight. Standard Finish under Devilment occurs at 19.5 seconds into the fight if your first Standard Finish hits precisely at the 0.000 second mark of the fight. Therefore, if using the first opener and you perfectly time the opening hit, you will have to delay your Standard Finish by half a second in order to be able to hit both Living Liquid and Liquid Hand with your Standard Finish on Liquid Hand. Alternatively, the forced clip in the second opener will always delay the Standard Finish long enough for the hand to spawn, and because of the buffed GCD, is a very small potency gain.</p>
<p>For the GCDs you do during this opening Technical Step, it is important to prioritize doing your single target procs (Reverse Cascade / Fountainfall) first before the Hand comes out so you can maximize your two target damage potential. You will still want to use Saber Dance before the Standard Step under Devilment if you get 60 Esprit before the 3rd GCD to prevent the possibility of overcapping esprit. After this Standard Finish, you should have 2-3 GCDs worth of time to hit both Living Liquid and Liquid Hand before tanks bait Hand of Parting. During this time you’ll want to prioritize Saber Dance > Bloodshower > Rising Windmill without dropping any procs. That means you can only do AT MOST two Saber Dances under Technical Finish Buff before you have to commit to using your proc GCDs otherwise you will drop a proc.</p>
<p>Save the Fan Dance III Proc from Flourish until Standard Finish (when Liquid Hand is summoned). Do not use any Feathers before this point in time. Once the Hand is out, use as many Feathers as you can on Fan Dance II to hit both Living Liquid and Liquid Hand. Remember to use any Fan Dance III procs that are generated during this to hit both as well.</p>

<p>When able to hit 2+ targets at the same time, it is worth it to do Windmill → Bladeshower as your base GCD combo over Cascade → Fountain. Additionally, it is worth it to use Fan Dance II instead of Fan Dance I on 2+ targets. For mechanics where you have to disengage from Living Liquid / Liquid Hand or the Boss targets have to be separated for a period of time, you will want to return to going back to single target Cascade → Fountain. If you have a combo’d Bladeshower available when forced to switch from hitting two targets to one target, you should use the combo’d Bladeshower if you can use it to hit one target and will be able to use the potential Bloodshower proc that is generated on two targets within the next 20 seconds. Additionally, Saber Dance should be saved as much as possible for times where you can hit both Living Liquid and Liquid Hand together. When using Standard Finish or Fan Dance III while single target debuffs (specifically Trick Attack and Chain Stratagem are up), you will want to make sure the primary damage is done to the target with Trick Attack / Chain Stratagem and the secondary damage is done to the other target (i.e. target whichever has those debuffs when using Fan Dance III and make sure you are closer to the one with those debuffs when using Standard Finish).</p>

<p>(Speed kills for this fight use a very difficult strategy that involves feeding all Dolls at the same time to maximize AoE potential and minimizes losses from switching to single target actions on the four separate Dolls. Those require very coordinated and planned AoE usage that gets all four dolls to &lt;25% in a consistent way. The tips here will just focus on if you are doing strats involving each DPS focusing their own Doll).</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the time the Jagd Dolls spawn happens about 5 GCDs before Standard Step is up again. The Jagd Doll is a DPS mechanic where the Jagd Doll needs to be damaged but not killed. The Jagd Doll has to be brought below 25% HP before it can be fed to the boss, otherwise it will cause a wipe. The problem with Standard Step is that it is a large amount of potency that has a chance to Crit and/or DH and can do a high % of the the Doll’s HP. So we can either use Standard Step on cooldown but in a very cautious way to prevent it from overkilling the Doll or we can delay.</p>
<p>Pros to using SS on Doll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to keep SS on cooldown which can potentially gain you an extra usage of SS for Phase One depending on when your group kills Living Liquid.</li>
<li>Not delaying SS and using it on cooldown means SS will come up during the Protean Eave baits / AoE puddle baits after second Cascade which means you won’t interrupt your AoE combo when disengaging.</li>
<li>You can hit three (potentially four targets) with your SS which gains you 250-500 extra potency versus only hitting Living Liquid and Liquid Hand.</li>
<li>If you hit another DPS’s Doll with SS, you could potentially gain them an extra GCD on Living Liquid / Liquid Hand due to helping them reach the &lt;25% threshold on their Doll.</li>
<li>By upfronting your biggest hitting ability (Standard Finish) before hitting the Doll hard and adjusting the number of regular Single Target GCDs you do later based on whether the Finish Crit/DHs, you increase the likelihood of bringing your Doll just below the 25% HP threshold to reduce the number of wasted GCDs on the Doll.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons to using SS on Doll:</p>
<ul>
<li>High variance to SS damage means the DNC will have to adjust the number of GCDs they do on the Doll which makes the timing of when the Doll gets fed variable (which can affect healing timing)</li>
<li>Variable in number of GCDs means DNC will have to be aware of approximately what percent of the Doll’s HP will be done by damage from various actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should communicate with your raid group to determine whether or not you should use Standard Step on your Doll as it requires coordination for feed strategies.</p>
<p>The Jagd Doll has about 164,000 HP, so it is important to know where the damage on your Doll is coming from. When the Doll spawns, you need to do a GCD on your Doll to tag it. You should tap the Doll with either Cascade, Reverse Cascade, or Fountain then switch back (if you are doing 1 > 3 > 2 > 4 before the dolls spawn, you’ll always be able to do one of these three GCDs over Fountainfall or Saber Dance). Then, you can switch back to Living Liquid / Liquid Hand for four GCDs before Standard Step comes off cooldown. After you use Standard Finish on your Doll, you can react to whether you got a Crit, DH, or Crit+DH on the Standard Finish and adjust for how many GCDs you need to do to bring the Doll down below 25% HP. Saber Dance should never be used on the Doll because you will miss out on significant cleave potential of Saber Dance on Living Liquid and Liquid Hand together. Additionally, it does a high amount of potency and can potentially overkill the Doll if it Crits and/or DH. Additionally, Feathers should be saved as much as possible for Fan Dance II that can be used to hit both Living Liquid and Liquid Hand.</p>
<p>Regarding Crit/DH variance, here is an attempt log of my Doll being overkilled by about 1200 damage. Our group’s strategy included our WHM using Assize to help with AoE heals while the Dolls were still alive so the damage from Assize had to be factored into my Doll planning. This attempt shows me using Cascade, Fountain, and then I switched back to Living Liquid / Liquid Hand to do three GCDs before Standard Step came back up. I also had two auto attacks on the Doll along and the WHM’s Assize hit the Doll as well.</p>

<p>On this log, you can see the Fountain (DH), the Standard Finish (Crit + DH), and the Assize (Crit) and ended up leading to an overkill of 1200 damage. Therefore, doing a Cascade + Fountain + Standard Finish can potentially be too much damage on the Doll if a WHM is using Assize as well. Therefore, doing one GCD to tag the Doll (either Cascade, Reverse Cascade, or Fountain depending on where you are with single target GCDs at that point in the fight) and then switching back to Living Liquid / Liquid Hand while waiting for Standard Step to come off cooldown, and then adjust how many GCDs you do on your Doll after Standard Finish goes off based on whether it Crit, DH’ed, or both. This will mean having to do anywhere between zero and four extra GCDs after the Standard Finish on the Doll in order to bring it down to right below 25%.</p>
<p>If you do not have a WHM using Assize at this point in the fight, you can do two GCDs on the Doll before switching back to Living Liquid / Liquid Hand.</p>

<p>If you kept Standard Step off cooldown since the beginning of the fight (including using it on the Jagd Doll), Standard Step will come off cooldown precisely when you have to disengage from the boss to bait Sluice. This means you do not have to interrupt your AoE combo despite disengaging the boss, because you can use those two GCDs to do a Standard Step instead.</p>
<p>Try to save 50+ Esprit towards the end of the phase for your Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser reopener so that you can do Technical Finish (Devilment) > Saber Dance (Flourish).</p>

<p>A decent time to use Shield Samba would be right as the six Splashes occur into second Cascade. Since Shield Samba lasts 15 seconds, it should be able to cover all six Splashes and the Cascade AoE damage. If using Standard Step on cooldown on the doll, Standard Step will come off cooldown on the GCD before the Splash damage comes out. If you miss that oGCD due to using Feathers (this coincides with a Flourish timing) and start the Standard Step, you can do Samba on the oGCD of the Finish but it will miss two to three of the AoE Splashes in mitigation.</p>

<p>I used this during the Doll damage to help recover some HP for me and my Dance Partner (BLM/SMN) who would feed their Doll fourth so we both took a little extra damage during Dolls compared to the other DPS (melee) who fed early.</p>
<p>If using Curing Waltz during the Dolls as mentioned, it will be up in time to use again at the end of the Living Liquid phase before Limit Cut as everyone gathers near the middle waiting for Hawk Blasters to help top everyone off coming out of that phase.</p>
<p>Other options include squeezing it in during the opening Technical window after Liquid Hand spawns and/or using it during Splashes/immediately after the Cascade. If used during Splashes, it can be used at the very beginning of P2 between Standard Finish and Technical Step after J-Kick.</p>

<p>Improvisation can be weaved before Second Cascade when Living Liquid, Liquid Hand, and the whole party is gathered near the middle. This will also provide the Healing buff which was helpful in our prog in snapshotting AoE regens and a succor shield for the post Second Cascade mechanics. If you don’t use it here, you can use it between Living Liquid dying and Limit Cut / Hawk Blasters appearing to gain some Esprit before Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser phase.</p>

<p>Consistency is the most important thing about this phase, since it is one of the most unforgiving phases of the fight and it is the phase you will do the most and wipe to the most. You’ll have to coordinate with you group for which Boss target you hit when you are unable to be close enough to do AoE GCDs (for my group, me and my BLM would do our single target GCDs on Liquid Hand to help even out the damage done to both). Once you and your group figure out the damage that is consistently done throughout the phase, you can decide when it is safe to focus on just Living Liquid without risking a wipe to Hand of Pain.</p>
<p>Flourish comes off cooldown at 1 minute during the Protean Wave > baited Sluice mechanic. This means you can use Flourish while you are disengaging from the bosses to bait Sluice and use your single target procs (Reverse Cascade and Fountainfall) while you are away from the bosses and unable to use AoE GCDs. However, you might drop your AoE combo’d Bladeshower if you keep Standard Step off cooldown (which as noted before lines up very nicely with baiting 2nd Sluice if kept off cooldown for the whole fight) due to using your single target procs when away from the boss and having to do Bloodshower before you can use the combo’d Bladeshower (otherwise potentially overriding a proc). I think ultimately it is worth it to drop this combo’d Bladeshower so that you’ll ensure you won’t have to drop AoE GCDs in the 2nd Sluice bait.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can start Standard Step when Cruise Chaser appears behind the person with the “5” above their head during Limit Cut. This is approximately 15 seconds before both Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser are targetable. If you are doing a very optimized speed run, you could potentially do Technical Step during Limit Cut instead of Standard Step (this would be assuming you opened Living Liquid with Technical Step as well). However, most people progressing through this fight will not be killing nearly fast enough to make pre-Technical Step worth it.</li>
<li>If you use Second Wind to recover from Doll damage, it will likely not be up to use during Limit Cut to recover from Alpha Sword damage before J-Kick.</li>
<li>It is also highly recommended to use Arm’s Length for the Alpha Sword / Super Blassty Charge mechanic.</li>

<p><em>(Assuming not the speed run strategy):</em><br>
It is highly recommended that tanks bring Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser together for the reopener to make it easier to cleave both of them.</p>
<p>-15 second Standard Step (during Limit Cut) > 2 Steps > Standard Finish (when both BJ and CC are targetable) > Technical Step (Devilment) > Saber Dance (Flourish) > two more GCDs > Standard Step > …</p>
<p>This reopener is very busy. You may find yourself generating a lot of Esprit and not knowing what to prioritize. Because you are able to hit two targets while Technical Step / Devilment are up, there become times where it actually is worth it drop a proc (specifically the single target procs Reverse Cascade and Fountainfall) especially if you will potentially overcap Esprit otherwise. The reason behind this is Saber Dance effectively goes from 600 potency to 900 potency when switching from 1 to 2 targets, while Reverse Cascade’s potency effectively only goes from 425 to 475 (due to the potential Feather being generated being able to hit two targets instead of one). Meanwhile, your AoE procs increase by an effective 200+ potency due to being able to hit two targets. If you have a NIN and/or a SCH, remember to focus the target that has Trick Attack and/or Chain Stratagem for the primary damage on your cleave abilities (i.e. Standard Finish, Saber Dance, Fan Dance III primary damage). While dodging Chakrams, you will likely have to disengage from the bosses and will not be able to hit both bosses with AoE GCDs. Because of this, it is important to prioritize the AoE proc GCDs earlier in the reopener so you can hit both targets, while saving the single target GCDs for later when the bosses are separated.</p>

<p>Being able to AoE during this phase is very dependent on what your group feels comfortable doing. It is possible to have both Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser on top of each other for the majority of this phase to allow for full cleaving to happen. However, this is not necessary to complete this phase and clear the fight. The DPS check for this phase is rather lenient, so doing cleave strategies is not required to clear. This is a conversation that can be had with your group. If your group wants to prioritize getting the clear and feel like cleave strategies are too difficult to do consistently, it may be better for your group to not do these strategies. Regardless, I’ll reshare general AoE priorities during this phase if you are able to hit more than one target.</p>
<p>When able to hit 2+ targets at the same time, it is worth it to do Windmill → Bladeshower as your base GCD combo over Cascade → Fountain. Additionally, it is worth it to use Fan Dance II instead of Fan Dance I on 2+ targets. For mechanics where you have to disengage from Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser or the Boss targets have to be separated for a period of time, you will want to return to going back to single target Cascade → Fountain. If you have a combo’d Bladeshower available when forced to switch from hitting two targets to one target, you should use the combo’d Bladeshower if you can use it to hit one target and will be able to use the potential Bloodshower proc that is generated on two targets within the next 20 seconds. Additionally, Saber Dance should be saved as much as possible for times where you can hit both targets together. When using Standard Finish or Fan Dance 3 while single target debuffs (specifically Trick Attack and Chain Stratagem are up), you will want to make sure the primary damage is done to the target with Trick Attack / Chain Stratagem and the secondary damage is done to the other target (i.e. target whichever has those debuffs when using Fan Dance III and make sure you are closer to the one with those debuffs when using Standard Finish).</p>
<p>Whenever you use Standard Finish during this phase, you’ll want to be sure you hit both Brute Justice <em>and</em> Cruise Chaser. If using Standard Step off cooldown from reopener and you are baiting the Missile Command AoEs, Standard Step will come off cooldown exactly while you are baiting along the edge of the arena. Because of this, it is actually worth it to hold Standard Step for about 3 GCDs in order to hit both Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser after you finish baiting and are handling the Enumeration mechanic.</p>

<p>Regarding whether to use a second Technical Step / Devilment during Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser, there are reasons to use the Technical Step / Devilment here and there are reasons for holding for Alexander Prime opener.</p>
<p>General pros of using Technical Step / Devilment post-Gavel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to use a total of eight Technical Steps / Devilments throughout the fight, ultimately granting you more overall damage from rDPS as well as personal damage gains from Technical Finish / Devilment buffs and extra Esprit.</li>
<li>Lowers overall kill time by being able to kill Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>General pros of using Technical Step / Devilment at Alexander Prime:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines up Technical Step / Devilment with the potion that would be used at the beginning of Alexander Prime, and effectively lines up all uses of Technical Finish / Devilment to decent times for ease of meeting the DPS checks of Alexander Prime and Perfect Alexander phases. (Alexander Prime and Perfect Alexander have tighter DPS checks than Living Liquid and Brute Justice / Cruise Chaser phases). Improving the DPS in these phases is more important than increasing your overall DPS in the fight if you are going for the clear. This strategy can be the difference between having one or two DPS die in an attempt during Wormhole and surviving the Trio Enrage sequence and meeting the DPS requirement of Alexander Prime versus failing that phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>So ultimately, holding Technical Step / Devilment (and other raid buffs) for Alexander Prime opener is generally a progression-safe strategy while using the raid buffs on cooldown is an optimized parse / speed strategy. Communicate with your raid group about what works best for your group’s needs.</p>

<p>It’s hard to get the full effect from Curing Waltz because you don’t want to stack on other players during the mechanics of this phase. The times where I used Curing Waltz in progression were after first Photon and after Whirlwind but before third Compressed Water / Lightning.</p>

<p>For the start of the Alexander Prime phase, start Standard Step when Brute Justice and Cruise Chase appear before Temporal Stasis. Use a potion right before you get frozen (note: there is no other time you can use a potion during this phase without delaying and potentially missing a potion usage during Perfect Alexander).</p>
<p>Alexander Prime is targetable for 30 seconds allowing for either 2 Standard Finishes (if you start Standard Finish during Temporal Stasis), 1 Technical Step/Finish (if TF/DM are up), and 7 GCDs &ndash;OR&ndash; 2 Standard Finishes and 9-10 GCDs (depending on how quickly you land the Standard Finish when Alexander Prime becomes targetable). The opener when Alexander Prime is targetable will look like one of two things (depending on whether Technical Step / Devilment are on cooldown).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Option One (with Technical Step / Devilment):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pop Potion right before getting frozen for Temporal Stasis</em> Standard Finish -> Technical Step -> Technical Finish (Devilment) -> Saber Dance (Flourish, Fan Dance III) -> Saber Dance (FD1) -> Fountainfall -> Bloodshower -> Standard Step -> Standard Finish -> Saber Dance -> Rising Windmill -> Reverse Cascade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option Two (no Technical Step / Devilment):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pop Potion right before getting frozen for Temporal Stasis</em> Standard Finish (Flourish) -> 6 GCDs - > Standard Step -> Standard Finish -> 3-4 more GCDs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event you are doing Option Two and are determining what to do for those last 3-4 GCDs, use basic DNC GCD priority (1 - <em><strong>3</strong></em> - 2 - <em><strong>4</strong></em>) with one small exception: if your third to last GCD before the boss jumps was a Cascade that procs a Reverse Cascade, do Fountain for the next GCD, wait to see if you get a Fountainfall proc and if you do, use Fountainfall as your last proc and let the Reverse Cascade drop, otherwise use Reverse Cascade. This is a small (50 potency) gain from optimizing which proc you let fall by fishing for a Fountainfall.</p>

<p>While Inception Formation is happening, you can use Standard Step on cooldown to keep the Standard Finish buff on you and your Dance Partner. It will come back so you will be able to pre-step before Alexander Prime is targetable again and still gain a usage of Standard Finish during that time. When the True Heart is available to hit, you should be hitting it to generate Esprit and Feathers (from using generated procs). You may be able to save a proc that is generated in this way for when Alexander Prime returns if it is a proc that is generated as your last GCD on the True Heart as it is running away and if you use it right after your Finish when Alexander Prime comes back.</p>
<p>You can use Shield Samba during Inception Formation for the x4 Tetrashatter damage. It will come back up to use during Trio Enrage if used at this time. Curing Waltz can be used to help heal people after Tetrashatter damage.</p>
<p>After Inception Formation, Alexander Prime becomes targetable for approximately 30 seconds again (same amount of time as after Temporal Stasis). Here, there are three recommendations for what to do for your rotation depending on whether you used Technical Step / Devilment during previous re-opener. Two of them are the same as the re-opener (just use the one with Technical Step / Devilment if you didn’t use it on re-opener, or vice versa) and the third rotation is an adjustment to the Technical Step/ Devilment rotation that may better ensure your group has Technical Step and Devilment up at start of Perfect Alexander (if you kill Alexander Prime rather quickly).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Option One (no Technical Step / Devilment):</p>
<ul>
<li>(Standard Step 10-15 seconds before Alexander Prime becomes targetable) Standard Finish (Flourish) -> 6 GCDs - > Standard Step -> Standard Finish -> three to four more GCDs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option Two (with Technical Step / Devilment):</p>
<ul>
<li>(Standard Step 10-15 seconds before Alexander Prime becomes targetable) Standard Finish -> Technical Step -> Technical Finish (Devilment) -> Saber Dance (Flourish, Fan Dance III) -> Saber Dance (FD1) -> Fountainfall -> Bloodshower -> Standard Step -> Standard Finish -> Saber Dance -> Rising Windmill -> Reverse Cascade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option Three (with Technical Step / Devilment):</p>
<ul>
<li>(Technical Step 10-15 seconds before Alexander Prime becomes targetable) Technical Finish (Devilment) -> Saber Dance (FD1) -> Standard Step -> Standard Finish (Flourish) -> etc…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Option Three has one less Standard Finish due to not pre-dancing a Standard Step and instead dancing Technical Step first. This puts Technical Step on cooldown sooner which allows for it to be used earlier during the Trio Enrage sequence for the next cast of Technical. If your group is killing Alexander Prime rather quickly, this will allow for a little bit more time for Technical Step to come up during the re-opener of Perfect Alexander.</p>
<p>Repeated here regarding what to do for your last couple of GCDs before boss jumps: in the event you are doing Option One or Option Three and are determining what to do for those last 3-4 GCDs, use basic DNC GCD priority (1 - <em><strong>3</strong></em> - 2 - <em><strong>4</strong></em>) with one small exception: if your third to last GCD before the boss jumps was a Cascade that procs a Reverse Cascade, do Fountain for the next GCD, wait to see if you get a Fountainfall proc and if you do, use Fountainfall as your last proc and let the Reverse Cascade drop, otherwise use Reverse Cascade. This is a small (50 potency) gain from optimizing which proc you let fall by fishing for a Fountainfall.</p>
<h2 id=wormhole-formation--pre-trio-enrage-alexander-prime>Wormhole Formation / pre-Trio Enrage Alexander Prime<a href=#wormhole-formation--pre-trio-enrage-alexander-prime class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>During Wormhole formation, use Improvisation wherever your party is stacking to bait Chakrams. Improvisation will be back up before Perfect Alexander transition if used at this time. Curing Waltz can be used to help top people off before Incinerating Heat damage goes off. However, if you use Curing Waltz here, you’ll have to delay when you precast Standard Step until after you use Curing Waltz. Otherwise, if you plan on not using Curing Waltz here, you can start Standard Step after Cruise Chaser dashes to the person with number 6 for the 15 second precast. It is also highly recommended to use Arm’s Length for the Alpha Sword / Super Blasty Charge mechanic.</p>
<p>When Alexander Prime becomes targetable, you <em>may</em> use Flourish here in order to gain an extra usage in the fight (at the tail end of the Alexander Prime enrage). This extra usage is very minor especially since you would be missing potential cleave potential from the Rising Windmill and Bloodshower hitting both Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser. However, for progress sake, it is recommended to save Flourish for the Trio Enrage sequence. Otherwise, keep Standard Step off cooldown like normal and hold Technical Finish / Devilment (if they are up) for the Trio Enrage.</p>
<h2 id=trio-enrage--perfect-alexander-transition>Trio Enrage / Perfect Alexander Transition<a href=#trio-enrage--perfect-alexander-transition class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>Depending on the timing of when you last used Technical Step / Devilment will affect when you use Technical Step / Devilment here. If last used after Temporal Stasis, you can use Technical Step when Alexander Prime disappears preparing for Trio Enrage. If you used Technical Step after Inception Formation, use Technical Step / Devilment as soon as they come off cooldown (even if it is several seconds into Trio Enrage).</p>
<p>During Trio Enrage, you are able to hit both Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser with AoE procs from Flourish (unless you used Flourish right before Trio Enrage on Alexander Prime) and Fan Dance II. This requires standing perfectly between the two bosses. Communicate with your team if you would like to be able to do this, because it may affect where others in your party stand (especially the healers, and especially if you have a WHM casting Cure III) and where Sacred Soil / Earthly Star are placed.</p>
<p>Communicate with your raid team for when the best time to use Shield Samba and Curing Waltz during Trio Enrage. For our group, we planned for me to use Shield Samba after the 5th J-Wave and to use Curing Waltz after the 9th J-Wave (with everyone stacked up).</p>
<p>After Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser are dead, you’ll want to communicate with your team whether you want to use this time to build up resources (if you have time to spare before his enrage finishes casting) or burn as fast as possible. If your damage is really good and your group wants to use this time to build up resources, you can spam Windmill and use Rising Windmill procs to generate Feathers and Esprit for Perfect Alexander reopener and buy time for others in your group to also build up their resources.</p>
<p>As Alexander Prime is performing Divine Judgment, you will want to use Improvisation to get up to 100 Esprit before the Perfect Alexander phase.</p>
<p>NOTE: Since the phase transition is exactly 60 seconds, it is impossible to keep up the Standard Finish buff through this transition.</p>
<h1 id=perfect-alexander>Perfect Alexander<a href=#perfect-alexander class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1>
<p>The Perfect Alexander phase of the fight is actually rather straightforward mechanically and has pretty good uptime (aside from Ordained Stillness, and the two Fate Calibration boss jumping mechanics). However, this is the phase of the fight with the tightest overall DPS check, so it is important to coordinate with your raid group to make a plan for when to use raid buffs.</p>
<h2 id=re-opener-perfect-alexander>Re-opener Perfect Alexander<a href=#re-opener-perfect-alexander class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>It is strongly recommended to pop potion at the very beginning of Perfect Alexander even if Technical Step / Devilment are not quite up yet (otherwise, you will lose some uptime of your second potion in Perfect Alexander before Jails). If Technical Step / Devilment are up at the beginning of Perfect Alexander, you can do the following re-opener:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Re-opener (Technical Finish + Devilment)</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical Step → four Steps → (hard clip potion) → Technical Finish (Devilment) → Saber Dance → Standard Step → two Steps → Standard Finish (Flourish) → continue with normal Technical Finish GCD priority</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This opener gives you a lot of room to get off all of your procs even with the forced march / ordained stillness mechanics affecting your ability to perform GCDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you do not have Technical Step / Devilment up right away you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Step → two Steps → (hard clip potion) → Standard Finish (Flourish) → Saber Dance → use your Proc GCDs and Standard Step when it comes up</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will desync Flourish from Technical Step / Devilment for the majority of the last phase, which may end up gaining you a usage of Flourish at the end of the fight. If delaying your Technical Step and Devilment, a good time to use it would be after the Ordained Motion/Stillness and Forced March mechanics have finished. Even though this is significantly outside of your potion window, you will be able to use Technical Step / Devilment off cooldown for the remainder of the fight with the third usage in Perfect Alexander realigning with the potion. Coordinate with the other members of your raid group to keep two minute raid buffs aligned.</p>
<p>Shield Samba can be used for Optical Sight damage (since there is no other good time to use it before the Irresistible Grace at the end of the fight).</p>
<h2 id=fate-calibration-alpha-ɑ>Fate Calibration Alpha (ɑ)<a href=#fate-calibration-alpha-ɑ class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>You can use Standard Step on cooldown, even during Fate Calibration Alpha (ɑ) but might need to hold for a second depending on whether the mechanic involves Ordained Stillness or not. Hold the Standard Finish until Perfect Alexander comes back.</p>
<p>Between Fate Calibration Alpha (ɑ) and Fate Calibration Beta (β), you will want to use Technical Step / Devilment as they come up (and aligned with the rest of your group’s two minute buffs).</p>
<h2 id=fate-calibration-beta-β-through-enrage>Fate Calibration Beta (β) through Enrage<a href=#fate-calibration-beta-β-through-enrage class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>Curing Waltz can be used after the Shared Sentence / Super Jump damage to help cover some of the healing to survive the Optical Sight damage.</p>
<p>Standard Step can be used as early as the Optical Sight cast is being done by the Perfect Alexander Mirage in order for it to be within 15 seconds of Perfect Alexander being targetable.</p>
<p>Communicate with your raid team with mitigation coordination whether you should use Shield Samba either for first Irresistible Grace or second. Curing Waltz can be used after the first Irresistible Grace (as well as a snapshotted flash of Improvisation heal buff).</p>
<p>The last Technical Finish / Devilment should be delayed to line up with when the potion comes off cooldown (which occurs as you are dodging into second Irresistible Grace).</p>
<p>For the enrage sequence, it makes sense for players to get jailed in the order of how much damage they do with lowest damage getting Jailed first. Since DNC does the least amount of damage at that point in the fight for the DPS jobs (especially outside of Technical / Devilment), DNC should go into the fifth Jail. If you have a GNB in your group, consider having the DNC go into the fourth Jail and the GNB going into the fifth Jail since they get more out of their No Mercy window (especially getting off a last usage of Gnashing Fang combo, Sonic Break, and Bow Shock) and need more time to get everything off. This GNB burst also does more damage than getting off a couple of proc GCDs from the DNC’s Flourish. The difference between fourth and fifth Jail for DNC does not affect how many Standard Finishes you can get off in that final phase as well, so ultimately it can be a net gain for your group for DNC to go fourth Jail and GNB to go fifth Jail.</p>

<p>Note that this is also not a full guide, but rather Dancer-specific tips for those looking to optimize performance on the newest EX trial. Please refer to one of the many other general guides for clarifications on mechanics.</p>
<p>Also note that this guide assumes your party DPS is not high enough to phase the boss early (by getting the boss down to 50% health before the scheduled adds phase). Please see the bottom of the document for a short discussion if it is.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Unlike many other fights, this EX trial is unique in that drifting SS even a single GCD in Phase 1 will lead to a DPS loss. Avoiding drift on SS allows you to dance during the short 3-4 seconds the boss is untargetable before adds spawn (around 3:46).</p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to do this consistently, this also means that if the first Imbued Sword ends up being Fire, you need to start SS right before the fire debuffs go out. Finish the rest of the steps after the pyretic debuff fades. Unfortunately, the timing for this can be tight, and if someone early-pulls or if you clip your rotation you will likely take at least one extra tick of fire damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=improvisation>Improvisation<a href=#improvisation class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ignoring Esprit fishing in the opener, Improvisation shines in this phase when Imbued Fire is <em>second</em> rather than first. This is because channeled abilities are not subject to the Pyretic debuff <em><strong>once the ability has already been cast</strong></em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As people are already stacked for Holy, simply weave Improvisation during the window before the fire debuffs go out.</p>
<ul>
<li>This should allow you to get 20 to 30 Esprit during this downtime. If you do start improvisation late at 85-90% of the cast bar, however, you may once again take an extra tick of fire damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>(For many of these, you may need to position yourself a bit closer to the middle to catch everyone before moving):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First: Halfway during the first Earthshaker cast bar. This will catch LB3 meteors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second:</p>
<ul>
<li>The raidwide before adds (a bit wasted as healers will shortly have down time to heal everyone else back up); OR</li>
<li>Beginning of adds, before you first receive your Flare.</li>

<ul>
<li>Going into adds phase in this trial is one of the few times where I will advocate for storing 4 Fans if possible without overcapping. This is because you have time to use Fan Dance II twice to splash both adds before they inevitably get pulled apart by the tanks.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Depending on how you are resolving the tether/stack/tower mechanics, Technical Step will need to be delayed anywhere from 2-4 GCDs to hit everyone with the buff. Note that there is enough time to deploy Technical Step in the middle of the arena even if you are responsible for a tether afterwards.</p>
<ul>
<li>As per usual, you should always position your dances such that they hit both targets where possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>If aiming to end the add phase as quickly as possible, one consideration is positioning yourself on one of the adds after the initial mechanics are done, selecting the far add and using LB2.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Wait for everyone to get back to middle and Improvisation. You should be able to get the full 50 esprit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have gained 50 esprit, this should coincide approximately with the text <em>“For victory, I render up my all!”</em> At any point when this text box shows up, you can start Standard Step as the boss will become targetable within the next 10-13 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>This also coincides around the time the tanks will be using LB3 if they are using it early.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Depending on how fast/slow the adds went down, Flourish should be weaved with Standard Finish to get it rolling again for the next tech window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, recommendations past this point are difficult as the fight becomes unpredictable; however, full uptime can be maintained for the remainder of the fight regardless of the order of mechanics</p>
<ul>
<li>(Although make sure to Arm’s Length the knockback from Ninja or you may lose a GCD).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are a few considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Step</strong> (and most other raid buffs) are probably no longer worth using for adds phase depending on how fast you ended Phase 1. Consider saving it for the re-opener.</li>
<li>The 3:46 <strong>Standard Step</strong> may become quite awkward to land if it comes up around the same time as add-phase Flares. Consider holding it until after Flares have resolved and you are back in the middle of the arena, as you are unlikely to get a second use out of SS during adds. This is especially true if you are also using LB on the adds.</li>
<li><strong>Improvisation</strong> should no longer be used for Phase 1’s second Imbued Weapon (assuming it was Fire), as it will still be on cooldown by the time post-adds transition occurs.</li>

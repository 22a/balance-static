<p>*Data on BLM SpS build as a dance partner is not available due to length in time to reach BiS with this build as of this update, but value as a dance partner is believed to drop significantly between the two builds due to under utilization of Devilment.</p>
<p>This priority list was made based on interactions between all jobs and DNC buffs and by using the new Partner Calculator (created by @Hint) which is a useful tool to help determine who in a given log would be the best Dance Partner:</p>
<p><a href=http://partnercalc.herokuapp.com/>http://partnercalc.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
<p>(It is strongly encouraged to use this tool with your own group&rsquo;s logs to help determine who would be the best Dance Partner).</p>

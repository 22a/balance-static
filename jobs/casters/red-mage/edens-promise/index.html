<p>In the first minute of the fight, it is preferred to hold your Swiftcast. This allows your Dualcast window to align better for later mechanics, such as for placing your bramble and tethers. What you need to use for the tether movement may vary based on the Brambles strategy your group does, but generally, a single Dualcast will likely be enough, adding Sprint if necessary. Do note that you can move as soon as the purple circle appears around your character, as the tethers have already snapshotted at this point.</p>
<p>For the first Anti-Air and Wide-Angle, you can handle these mechanics in a variety of ways. One option is to use Displacement to jump to the corner where your safe spot is, but this may not work with all strategies. You can also take this opportunity to use the Swiftcast you held up until now, and also Sprint, if you have not used it yet, to safely move into place. If the first mechanic is Anti Air, you have time to do an extra Dualcast before moving into position, as the first AOE she uses in this scenario is a circular AOE directly around her. If she casts Wide-Angle first, you can safely cast another Dualcast by standing behind her hitbox at the edge, outside of the range of the arena-wide cleave, and then quickly move into your corner before the following mechanics. An example clip of movement making use of Swiftcast can be found below:</p>

<p>Your first melee combo going into tiles phase can be done on a near panel before moving out to your ranged panel as clouds spawn.</p>
<p>Depending on your mana levels and pattern for the Art of Darkness half-room cleave, it may be ideal to hold your Manafication here until after tiles, doing a regular melee combo when moving center to refresh your tiles. Holding your melee combo here until after tiles will not negatively affect your six minute pot window.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should not use Embolden unless you are on a center tile, to ensure that it does not miss anyone in the group. Some groups may consider holding buffs until after tiles as well, in which case, you should simply hold it to align with the group.</p>
<h2 id=potion-and-double-melee-timings>Potion and Double Melee Timings<a href=#potion-and-double-melee-timings class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>The ideal place to use your potion and do your double melee combo here is during the towers in the second forest phase, to align with the six minute buff window. You can hold the Manafication that comes up here to set this window up. One of your combos here will likely align with the movement you need to do for tethers into towers, allowing you to easily keep uptime during this phase, as seen in the below clip.</p>
<p>You may be in a scenario where your group is killing before the six minute buff window. If this is the case, you should delay your four minute buffs for after tiles, and aim to do your double melee combo and pot there. With an early six minute kill time, it may be possible to get a final use of Manafication and Scorch. However, this is very dependent on kill time and your position during tiles, so this will vary on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>When your Manafication comes off cooldown around the four minute mark, you will likely have to move off the boss to avoid Barbs of Agony (unless your group is mitigating this hit). In either scenario, you will likely have high mana levels when this comes off cooldown, allowing you to hold this Manafication until after a regular melee combo. Doing this will also help your rotation later in the fight, making the six minute potion window easier to execute smoothly.</p>
<h2 id=potion-and-double-melee-timings-1>Potion and Double Melee Timings<a href=#potion-and-double-melee-timings-1 class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>Your potion and double melee combo here will happen during the first Void Gate towers. As movement during this mechanic can be tight depending on the shadow pattern you receive, you can use these combos to your advantage when keeping uptime.</p>
<h1 id=e11s>E11S<a href=#e11s class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1>
<h2 id=opener-contre-sixte-and-swiftcast-hold>Opener Contre Sixte and Swiftcast Hold<a href=#opener-contre-sixte-and-swiftcast-hold class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>In your opener, swap your initial Fleche with Contre Sixte. This allows you to gain an extra use of Contre Sixte before the boss jumps. In order to keep Contre Sixte on cooldown, you should hold your Swiftcast until the end of the phase to keep its cooldown consistent with your weave windows. You can use your Swiftcast to gain an extra GCD before the boss jumps at the end of the phase. At 2.5 GCD, this GCD may ghost, but it will still generate the mana from its cast.</p>
<h2 id=opener-lightning-spread>Opener Lightning Spread<a href=#opener-lightning-spread class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>If the first Elemental Break used is lightning, there are two ways this can be handled. One is to adapt your opener to be an X-10 rather than an X-8, allowing you to start your melee combo after the spread mechanic, as seen in the below clip:</p>
<div class="embed video-player">
<iframe class=youtube-player type=text/html width=640 height=385 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmtJvF3txSM allowfullscreen frameborder=0></iframe>
</div>
<p>Another option is to discuss with your group to make room for you around the boss. If standing at max melee, you can easily have five people positioned around the boss. An example of this can be seen below:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DmDG9Jn.png alt></p>
<h2 id=bound-of-faith>Bound of Faith<a href=#bound-of-faith class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>When you are targeted by the Bound of Faith tether, if you are standing in the boss’s hitbox, you will be pushed out of his hitbox, interrupting your cast. You should stand outside of the bosses' hitbox to avoid this.</p>
<h2 id=first-light-mechanics-manafication-and-swiftcast-hold>First Light Mechanics Manafication and Swiftcast Hold<a href=#first-light-mechanics-manafication-and-swiftcast-hold class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>When your Manafication around the four minute mark comes off cooldown during the first set of Light mechanics, you will likely be at extremely high mana levels. You should hold this Manafication, doing a regular combo first while moving for the first light Burnt Strike.</p>
<p>During the downtime of Shifting Sky, prepare a Dualcast using Vercure to use when the boss becomes targetable. After doing this, you should hold your Swiftcast until after the first Light Elemental Break, and use it before the first Light Burnt Strike. This allows your dualcast windows to line up with movement necessary for these mechanics, such as stacking with your group for the Light proteans. An example can be seen here.</p>

<p>When your second potion comes off cooldown around the 4:30 mark, you should use it immediately on cooldown to ensure it is up quickly after Prismatic Deception later in the fight. Because of downtime, your group can also consider delaying the four minute buff window to 4:30, as this will not cost a use or cause you to drift buff later into the fight.</p>
<p>On RDM, there are many ways this potion window can be handled. It is extremely tight, if not impossible to catch two full combos under your potion here without heavily overcapping mana, which is not recommended. A reasonable compromise if you are unsure what to do with this potion window is to delay your Manafication that you are already holding by a few extra GCDs, lining it up so that your potion can be weaved in between Enchanted Redoublement and your first finisher, allowing you to catch a Manafication buffed Verflare/Verholy and Scorch under potion. An example of this can be seen in the below clip:</p>

<p>Your third potion will be used on cooldown after Prismatic Deception. Under this potion, you should aim to fit two full melee combos under the potion and buffs.</p>

<p>In order to keep full uptime during Diamond Dust, you should use your melee combo to your advantage. At 2.5 GCD, you should start your melee combo immediately after the Diamond Dust cast ends. Doing so will have your Scorch line up with the appearance of the ice floor, allowing you to use Scorch before sliding to keep your GCD rolling. You can then perform a Dualcast combo, sliding into place after your instant cast. If you need to slide a second time, a Swiftcast can be used here as well. Manafication can be used on cooldown here to keep uptime during icicles. An example can be seen below:</p>

<p>When your four minute Manafication comes up, you may already be very close to a regular combo. If you are above ~65|65 Black and White mana, you can consider holding this Manafication. This will affect your combo timings during Lions later in the fight, so it may be worthwhile to try both and see which lines up better with your group’s strategy.</p>

<p>Your second potion will be using either during or after the Lions mechanic. If you’re not already pushing enrage, your group may want to hold buffs until after lions. Despite this, you may have to do your first melee combo if you do not want to overcap during the mechanic. In this scenario, you can use your potion and do your first melee combo during Lions, and use your Manafication combo along with Embolden after the mechanic ends.</p>

<p>You may want to consider holding the first Swiftcast slightly to avoid a scenario where because of incorrect mana levels, you can not finish your melee combo before the first Darkest Dance knockback. You can still use this Swiftcast early, but keep a close eye on your mana levels as you do so.</p>

<p>Both your Manafication and Embolden should be held until after every relativity mechanic resolves, to align each with party buffs consistently.</p>

<p>During Single Apocalypse, you will likely have enough mana for a melee combo after the large jump AOE. You can safely dualcast your way through the center here and perform a melee combo on the boss before the rotating AOEs begin, as seen in this clip.</p>

<p>Aim to cap both of your gauges at 100|100 Black and White mana heading into Advanced Relativity to perform a double combo afterwards. After the mechanic resolves, there will be a moment where the boss is still untargetable. Use this chance to prepare a Dualcast using Vercure, allowing you to instantly cast a Verthunder or Veraero and weave your pot before starting your two melee combos.</p>

<p>Full uptime can be kept during Triple Apocalypse with proper Swiftcast Usage:</p>

<p>Additionally, depending on where your tank baits the initial jump, a safe spot may exist that does not require you to move back center:</p>

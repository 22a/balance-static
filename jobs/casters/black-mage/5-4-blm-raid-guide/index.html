<p>Some initial suggestions for Ley Lines usage and other fight-specific information/recommendations. They are not guaranteed to universally be the best way to do the fights, and based on various factors like kill time, optimization, positioning/strats, etc. you might consider shifting uses or handling things differently. However, you can use these as a starting point to develop your own plan.</p>
<p>Highly recommended to check out the caster mitigation doc <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NAUgh_3gKfL3FGitNVxL5zPnQg1ytC1QHH_jY3syDgY/edit>here</a> for good places to use Addle. Check with your healers to see if they might want any specific timings, or if you could help them with a Manaward in a specific spot in a fight.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id=edens-promise-umbra-savage-e9s>Eden’s Promise: Umbra (Savage) [E9S]<a href=#edens-promise-umbra-savage-e9s class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1>
<p>LL usage roughly on CD is recommended:</p>
<p>Normal opener > Wide Angle (WA)/Anti-air (AA) position > tiles between outer and inner tile > under boss for summon > after towers in WA/AA positioning > during tiles phase between the outer and inner tile as before</p>
<p>1: As usual in opener</p>
<p>2: Mostly recommended on edge for WA/AA. Try to not put them far into the corner, and stand on the inner edge of them to try to stick close to the party. Make sure that you&rsquo;re not missing any raid buff going out (ideally healers/DPS are between the boss and you, with everyone in range). Consider weaving Manaward if needed to survive the raidwide, if you miss any healing/mitigation.</p>
<p>2a: If your group is unable to let you stay out at the edge without you missing buffs, a slight delay until you are back mid can be warranted. Place them so you can be on either side of the left/right cleave then in position for stack/spread, without having to leave your LL.</p>
<p>3: Position your LL so you can be on the front or back tile without having to leave them. If they will still be up when the donut AoE occurs (especially if you delay the second use), make sure that they are slightly more on the inner tile so you don’t have to leave to dodge.</p>
<p>4: Place them directly under the boss when they&rsquo;re available. Dodge into the safe spot for summon on the edge of your LL. If they are still up for the tankbuster, make sure you&rsquo;re standing on the opposite side of the centerline of the boss where the tankbuster laser is being pointed.</p>
<p>5: After towers, in the WA/AA positioning similar to the second use.</p>
<p>6: Similar use as the one during the earlier tiles phase.</p>
<p><strong>General notes:</strong></p>
<p>- AM (or any other movement ability) through brambles has a chance to snapshot you in them and give you a heavy tick of damage, which will often lead to quick death thereafter. Avoid whenever possible, unless you will die otherwise.</p>
<p>- All bramble strats are fairly manageable, though ones that allow for more clean lines to AM to the corner are preferred. In the case of happy brambles, you may need to move out to the side slightly before you can AM safely.</p>
<p>- Consider using one of triple or proc + swift for brambles movement, and the other for WA/AA movement. You can move as soon as the purple AoE appears beneath you for breaking bramble tethers.</p>
<p>- Tiles phase</p>
<p>- Clouds only have ~133k HP so it is very easy to overkill them/kill them faster then be stuck facing away with nothing to hit while the gaze resolves. Consider using a cast or two on the boss instead of just focusing the cloud when it spawns, and potentially have someone else kill your cloud if it&rsquo;s left with very low HP.</p>
<p>- For slowing the cloud down, you don&rsquo;t have to be up close to it, just in its path. Similarly for the donut AoE, you can be around three-quarters of the way back on the inner tile and be safe from the AoE. Don&rsquo;t move more than you need to.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id=edens-promise-litany-savage-e10s>Eden’s Promise: Litany (Savage) [E10S]<a href=#edens-promise-litany-savage-e10s class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1>
<p>Being aggressive with using LL on cd can net more overall uptime with less comfortable uses. Slight delay can make uses cozier, but may cost a use. Consider what may be best for you based on your killtime and situation.</p>
<p>Strict: Prepull south -> Dualspell -> Under boss for first orbs -> Fade to shadow -> Voidgate (VG) 1 -> Pre-Shackled Apart -> Giga Slashes after Pitch Bog</p>
<p>Relaxed: Prepull south -> Dualspell -> Under boss for first orbs -> Delay to 4x Implosions (use under boss) -> Tail end of VG1 -> After Shackled Apart -> After VG2</p>
<p>1: Prepull directly south near the edge of the arena so you have three-quarters of a chance of staying in them for the first Implosion, and are already in position for the out mechanic afterwards.</p>
<p>2: On CD during Dualspell. Place them so the inner edge you can be in the stack, outer edge out of stack. It often isn&rsquo;t vital for you to be in the stack either&ndash;especially if static, double check with your healers, and consider offering addle as mitigation for the stack damage. For the following Shadowkeeper, you can bait your shadow cleave at one edge of your LL and move to the other, without having to leave them. Back to front, front to back, or even side to side all are sufficient.</p>
<p>3: Under boss for orbs. You can stand on the edge closer to where your assigned orb group is to be in the stack, as long as they aren&rsquo;t too far out. Can always play it safe with a minor delay to place them closer to your orb group.</p>
<p><strong>Strict timing:</strong></p>
<p>Use in the center for Fade to Shadow. Aim to move out with an instant for the AoE snapshot&ndash;the AoE goes off more with the animation than with the AoE disappearing, so you may have more time than you think.</p>
<p>Use on CD before Shackled Apart, can get most of a solid use here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Relaxed timing:</strong></p>
<p>Delay until 4x Implosion. Place in the center and dodge to the safe spots for Implosions on the edge of your LL.</p>
<p>Place after Shackled Apart, in the position you are dropping your Pitch Bog AoE. Further uses can be used on CD from here.</p>
<p><strong>General notes:</strong></p>
<p>- For movement during Implosions, if the first two shadows spawn 90 degrees apart you can stand in one spot to be safe from both without having to move. If this occurs during 4x implosions, you can do this then move diagonally through boss and be safe for the following two cleaves.</p>
<p>- Especially if you&rsquo;re not being strict on LL timing, you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to prepull LL. There is also potential to place them in mid if you&rsquo;re not using them prepull, and swift out -> BtL back in for the out (or utilize AM).</p>
<p>- If using LL south, consider requesting healer/ranged to stand to the E/W just north of the center for AM to dodge Implosion in case it is south. This allows you to dodge the cleave and already be away from boss for the following mechanic.</p>

<p>Prepull -> Turn of Heavens safe spot -> After Shifting Sky in protean spot -> On CD in center -> After Sundered Sky in protean spot -> After Prismatic Deception.</p>
<p>1: Prepull LL. Consider asking for a south protean spot at the start and swap for later in the fight, if possible. Another consideration is having the boss pulled facing south so you&rsquo;re closer to the relative north instead.</p>
<p>2: Use out to the side in the safe spot for Turn of the Heavens. Consider going to the north-ish safe spot to have better chances of the Burnt Strike not pointing near your direction.</p>
<p>3: After Shifting Sky in your protean spot, allowing for room to handle both fire/lightning without griefing anybody.</p>
<p>4: In the very center of the arena. The safe spot for Right of the Heavens is very large, you can safely stand on the edge of your LL near the safe panels and be fine. Note: there is an uptime strat where the powder mark tank may stand on the other side of the boss for the powder mark going off before moving to stand with the party. There is risk of getting clipped by this explosion.</p>
<p>5: After Sundered Sky, in your protean spot.</p>
<p>6: After Prismatic Deception.</p>
<p><strong>General notes:</strong></p>
<p>- The protean AoEs are very narrow&ndash;you can stand closer to other people than you might think. Close enough that you can avoid clipping each other for it but be close enough for fire/holy stack.</p>
<p>- Burnt Strike is aimed at a random party member. To increase your odds of it being pointed conveniently, try to be 90 degrees away from as many people as possible relative to the boss.</p>
<p>- For positioning for Bound of Faith (tether), aim to be just outside of the boss' hitbox. If you&rsquo;re inside, he pushes you out and interrupts your cast. If you&rsquo;re far out, the boss dashes out to you, making things awkward for tank/melee.</p>
<p>- You will generally get more value using Surecast on any fire Burnt Strikes during uptime, even if it means having to run in for the knockback during Shifting/Sundered sky.</p>
<p>- For Cycles of Faith, try to get a protean spot that&rsquo;s not south. While south is doable, the boss faces towards MT for the burnt strikes, so having a spot to the sides is far easier to manage.</p>
<p>- Your healers will probably love you if you if you get the lightning tether and Manaward the DoT.</p>

<p>Prepull -> On CD before Shiva -> Hold until after Titan -> On CD afterwards</p>
<p>1: Prepull LL.</p>
<p>2: Using prepull LL allows for a solid use before Shiva instead of having to delay until afterwards, or have a very poor use here.</p>
<p>3: Holding until after Titan allows for an easier full uptime use, and makes alignment for following uses have very easy timing. In most cases this will not cost a use and is the recommended strategy for the majority of players.</p>
<p>General notes:</p>
<p>- The room cleaves are slightly less than 270 degrees. Make sure you don&rsquo;t move more than you have to.</p>
<p>- For Shiva spread, having a spot directly underneath her can be beneficial &ndash; it&rsquo;s often not used and won&rsquo;t impact other people, and you can already be one step in the safe spot from the cleave to be in your spread position already.</p>
<p>- Manaward can put in good work during Diamond Dust, especially if you&rsquo;re progging or in PF where healing/mitigation might not be fully sorted out. Physical damage sucks.</p>
<p>- During statues, you can stand directly between the two adds and be safe from the baited beams.</p>
<p>- If you&rsquo;re killing the boss around the 7-minute mark, squeezing a use in during Titan can be beneficial. You can position your LL to cover two spots and hope you get lucky, or consider BLM-relative titan positioning for the first two sets (LL are over by the third)&ndash;see <a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/627154261804974080/799572687176335420/blm_uptime.png>here</a> for a recommended positioning, with potential <a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/641700495949430785/799369745177640960/BLMrocks12.xml>trigger</a> by Aya Liz if interested.</p>

<p>Prepull -> In center before Basic Relativity -> After you move in for Singular Apocalypse -> After you move in for Dual Apocalypse -> After Advanced Relativity -> During Terminal Relativity</p>
<p>1: Prepull south. Ideally the boss is also pulled south here so you&rsquo;re already up close to the boss for the following mechanics.</p>
<p>2: On CD in mid before Basic Relativity. The initial prepull use allows you to get more uptime here before you have to move. In the case you have fire (short or long) you can stay directly in mid under the boss. There&rsquo;s room for you in the center without hitting anyone even if it&rsquo;s fast fire. If you have ice and have to bait first, you can wait a bit to move out and still get most of the uptime in your LL.</p>
<p>3: After you move in for Singular Apocalypse, drop your LL dead center. You can stay in mid after the stack in your LL. If you have someone else staying mid with you (i.e. WHM) you can stand on one edge of your LL, with the other person on the opposite edge, slightly outside of your LL. Neither of you will be clipped by the AoEs or by each other if you&rsquo;re selected for Spirit Taker.</p>
<p>4: Similar to the previous use, use them in mid after moving in for Dual Apocalypse. Be considerate of how your tank is baiting Somber Dance (you may have to be a bit more on the edge of your LL close to boss). Make sure people are aware that you are staying in your LL for the Spirit Raker after the stack (and you can move to the other edge of your LL if needed to accomodate).</p>
<p>5: Good spot for reopener after Advanced Relativity, and then final use when available during Terminal Relativity.</p>
<p><strong>General notes:</strong></p>
<p>- Try to refresh AF/UI prior to the stuns for Relativities (particularly for Basic/Intermediate). If you&rsquo;re unable to, Transpose is better than letting stacks drop as you get moved to your return spots for the mechanics.</p>
<p>- For spread positioning for the purple debuff, you can safely take a spot directly under the boss without clipping others spread out around her hitbox.</p>

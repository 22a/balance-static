For weapons: item level (ilvl)/weapon damage (wd) wins, regardless of substats. For armor: ilvl usually wins, unless 5 materia slots.

FFXIV: Shadowbringers Patch 5.25, April 2020 With thanks to members of the Balance Discord for discussion and theorycrafting (Jahudant and Boxer) Images and icons are properties of Square Enix Foreword With the release of Shadowbringers, Samurai is now celebrating two years in the game, and with Aureum’s permission I’m taking over as caretaker for this guide. The 5.0 update brings with it several changes to both Samurai and melee as a whole, but due to the nature of this guide, I will be introducing them for players new to the job.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:18:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Level 50 Level 50 Opener
Keep buffs up, reapply your Higanbana as close to zero as possible, Midare goes brrrrrr.
Level 52 You learn Kenki Mastery I, which introduces the Kenki gauge and positionals on Gekko/Kasha. Use Kaiten exclusively on Iaijutsu (Higanbana &amp;gt; Midare).
Level 60 Level 60 Opener
Use the above and read Level 52 for the rest.
Level 62 You learn Kenki Mastery II. Begin to Kaiten all Iaijutsu, use excess Kenki on Shinten, use Level 70 Openers.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:50:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon (or Delirium)? The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:44:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Dark Knight Best In Slot Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS sets will otherwise not be maintained on this page.

White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Best in Slot</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:04:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/best-in-slot/</guid><description>5.5 AST BiS SETS https://bit.ly/astgearcalc
So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.
Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&amp;rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</guid><description>So, you&amp;rsquo;re (hopefully) comfortable with the fundamentals of Astrologian. Now, it’s time to talk details: quirky mechanics, important interactions, and optimization. We’ll start with the most straightforward topics and work up to the more complicated ones.
Sect Swapping/Stance Dancing In dungeons, you can swap to Nocturnal Sect after the last enemy in a pull dies, apply a shield to the tank in preparation for the next pull, and then swap back to Diurnal Sect.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:58:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</guid><description>What Sect Should I Use? Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:51:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</guid><description>Opener The most up to date Astrologian opener(s) can always be found in the #ast_resources channel on The Balance Discord. Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are extremely flexible and depend almost entirely on the circumstances of the fight, the timings of the planned raid DPS bursts, and party composition. Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:48:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>PvE actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Malefic 1 Spell 400 1.5s 2.5s Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 150.

There is the assumption you know all of the basics of BLM, including abbreviations and fundamentals. If not, refer to the BLM Basic Guide before proceeding here.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:53:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</guid><description>Q: What is Umbral Soul used for? A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -&amp;gt; Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:51:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</guid><description>Openers Openers should put abilities on cooldown, fit strong spells within buff windows, and minimize clipping. All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spellspeed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</guid><description>PvE actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Blizzard 1 Spell 400 2.5s 2.5s Deals ice damage with a potency of 180.

Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/astrologian-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/astrologian-guide/</guid><description>Intro to Astrologian Who Needs MP When You’re This Pretty?

It is normal-quality, meaning it is significantly weaker than other gear of the same item level. The Steel Cuirass (ilvl30), for example, has about the same defense as a high-quality Iron Scale Mail (ilvl 23).

All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spellspeed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title>Openers and Rotation</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/openers-and-rotation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/openers-and-rotation/</guid><description>In each opener, the first number refers to which GCD Embolden is used at, and the second refers to which GCD Manafication is used at.

This allows your Dualcast window to align better for later mechanics, such as for placing your bramble and tethers. What you need to use for the tether movement may vary based on the Brambles strategy your group does, but generally, a single Dualcast will likely be enough, adding Sprint if necessary.</description></item><item><title>RDM Fight Tips: The Epic of Alexander (TEA)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/rdm-fight-tips-the-epic-of-alexander-tea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/rdm-fight-tips-the-epic-of-alexander-tea/</guid><description>Table of Contents Credits General Fight Tips Phase 1: Living Liquid Phase 2: Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser Phase 3: Alexander Prime Phase 4: Perfect Alexander Clear PoVs Clear Logs General Fight Tips Managing Resources For all phases in TEA you should aim to finish capped with, or very close to 100 | 100 Black and White mana.

XIVAnalysis is a tool aimed at helping you improve your performance, through both automatic suggestions and metrics. None of the metrics are fight specific, but it is very useful to see your general performance at a glance. When we look at your logs in #rdm_questions, we use XIVA.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t Engagement worse than Displacement?
Engagement is 50 less potency than Displacement, however, unlike Displacement which requires a full weave window, it can be double weaved and is a safer option in many situations.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/red-mage-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/red-mage-guide/</guid><description>Overview

BLM has no bad substats.
Infinite resources and lack of damaging oGCDs makes Spell Speed a strong stat. More SpS can make the job feel smoother to play and make Fire Phases less strict. Aim for higher iLvl gear and get SpS to personal preference and comfort level.</description></item><item><title>Stats and Materia</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/stats-and-materia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/stats-and-materia/</guid><description>Melding Priority for Red Mage is;

The general idea for Ultimates is to map out your rotation for each phase and be as optimal as possible in the usage of your Meikyo Shisui and Higanbana (and Tsubame for level 80). In stark comparison to Savage that also means you generally want to avoid the usage of Hagakure unless it&amp;rsquo;s required for you to start a phase with a specific Sen setup.</description></item><item><title>Ultimates</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/ultimates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/ultimates/</guid><description>The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCoB) Gearing For level 70 Ultimates, a full set of synced gear with Critical Hit + Determination and enough pieces with Critical Hit + Skill Speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 418 or higher will max out both substats in UCoB. Gear from the Swallow&amp;rsquo;s Compass dungeon and +2 Eureka armor matches the item level sync and may provide a small boost.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Best in Slot and Gearing</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot-and-gearing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot-and-gearing/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s my BIS?!

But to get there, you first must begin on the road.
Unlocking White Mage is done upon reaching level 30 with the Conjurer class and completing the quest Seer Folly after completing the MSQ quest Sylph-management.</description></item><item><title>WHM Stats and Materia</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stats-and-materia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stats-and-materia/</guid><description>What Substats Does WHM Want? What Should I Meld? This priority applies to dungeon gear, prog gear, raid gear&amp;hellip; LITERALLY EVERYTHING.
If you&amp;rsquo;re leveling up or working on prog, grab Piety to comfort and then:
Crit &amp;gt; Det | DH
The most important stat for any healer is piety until you have enough of it, and then any more than you need has no use.
I cannot tell you how much piety is right for you and your situation.</description></item></channel></rss>

For weapons: item level (ilvl)/weapon damage (wd) wins, regardless of substats. For armor: ilvl usually wins, unless 5 materia slots. For same-ilvl pieces: substat itemization can be in your favor or not depending on the rest of your gear and stat tiering.

FFXIV: Shadowbringers Patch 5.25, April 2020 With thanks to members of the Balance Discord for discussion and theorycrafting (Jahudant and Boxer) Images and icons are properties of Square Enix Foreword With the release of Shadowbringers, Samurai is now celebrating two years in the game, and with Aureum’s permission I’m taking over as caretaker for this guide. The 5.0 update brings with it several changes to both Samurai and melee as a whole, but due to the nature of this guide, I will be introducing them for players new to the job.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:18:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Level 50 Level 50 Opener
Keep buffs up, reapply your Higanbana as close to zero as possible, Midare goes brrrrrr.
Level 52 You learn Kenki Mastery I, which introduces the Kenki gauge and positionals on Gekko/Kasha. Use Kaiten exclusively on Iaijutsu (Higanbana &amp;gt; Midare).
Level 60 Level 60 Opener
Use the above and read Level 52 for the rest.
Level 62 You learn Kenki Mastery II. Begin to Kaiten all Iaijutsu, use excess Kenki on Shinten, use Level 70 Openers.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Best in Slot</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:04:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/best-in-slot/</guid><description>5.5 AST BiS SETS https://bit.ly/astgearcalc
So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.
Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&amp;rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</guid><description>So, you&amp;rsquo;re (hopefully) comfortable with the fundamentals of Astrologian. Now, it’s time to talk details: quirky mechanics, important interactions, and optimization. We’ll start with the most straightforward topics and work up to the more complicated ones.
Sect Swapping/Stance Dancing In dungeons, you can swap to Nocturnal Sect after the last enemy in a pull dies, apply a shield to the tank in preparation for the next pull, and then swap back to Diurnal Sect.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:58:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</guid><description>What Sect Should I Use? Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:51:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</guid><description>Opener The most up to date Astrologian opener(s) can always be found in the #ast_resources channel on The Balance Discord. Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are extremely flexible and depend almost entirely on the circumstances of the fight, the timings of the planned raid DPS bursts, and party composition. Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:48:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>PvE actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Malefic 1 Spell 400 1.5s 2.5s Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 150.

BLM has no bad substats.
Infinite resources and lack of damaging oGCDs makes Spell Speed a strong stat. More SpS can make the job feel smoother to play and make Fire Phases less strict. Aim for higher iLvl gear and get SpS to personal preference and comfort level.</description></item><item><title>Stats and Materia</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stats-and-materia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stats-and-materia/</guid><description>Astrologian Stats and Materia What should I meld? Outside of Best in Slot, your meld priority should be;
Piety to comfort (if needed) Sps if you want to hit a certain GCD tier Crit Det/dh Sps. That said, the difference between meld setups is so small overall that you could opt for Det over Crit, or take more Spell Speed than usual if that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re more comfortable with during prog.</description></item><item><title>Stats and Materia</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/stats-and-materia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/samurai/stats-and-materia/</guid><description>Samurai Substat Priority Pre-Level 80:

The general idea for Ultimates is to map out your rotation for each phase and be as optimal as possible in the usage of your Meikyo Shisui and Higanbana (and Tsubame for level 80). In stark comparison to Savage that also means you generally want to avoid the usage of Hagakure unless it&amp;rsquo;s required for you to start a phase with a specific Sen setup.</description></item></channel></rss>

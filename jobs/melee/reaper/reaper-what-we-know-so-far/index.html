<h1>Reaper - What we know so far</h1>
<div class=content>
<p>As we prepare for Endwalker, the Balance Team is keeping a close eye on anything Reaper related. Currently we only have the job introduction trailer and below will be some an analysis of this video. I wanted to spend sometime addressing where the biggest source of our information will come from, pre launch &ndash; The media tour.</p>
<p>For Shadowbringers the media tour was a pretty huge success, not only for media content creators but also for guide writers and theorycrafters. For the first time we had a ton of detail and information available BEFORE the expansion launched. This gave every job the ability to lay groundwork on rotations and math. We are hoping for a repeat of that success this year. We are currently looking for any content creator, who is attending the media tour, to partner up with us and assist us with obtaining as much information as possible. If you are a content creator who is attending the media tour and you want to help contribute with Reaper theorycrafting, please contact me.</p>
<p>Now for the video analysis:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfqi_ow02rE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfqi_ow02rE</a></p>
<p>This video is very short and honestly doesn&rsquo;t give us a whole lot to work with. But let&rsquo;s see what we can gather or assume from the video.</p>
<p>For GCD rotations, we get two of them from what I can tell.</p>
<p>The animation at :24 in the video is the first GCD we see. I&rsquo;d take a wager and guess that is the first hit of the combo. At :27 we see the second GCD.</p>
<p>This may not be indicative of much, but from what we can tell the first two GCDs do not seem to apply a status to the user or the mob. That doesn&rsquo;t mean these skills won&rsquo;t, it just means that when they made this video they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They go on to repeat the 1-2 Combo a few times but at different angles. We don&rsquo;t actually see a new ability until around :33. We also don&rsquo;t get much insight about this ability until around :41 were we see it being used at almost the same time as the number 2 hit in the combo. I think we can safely assume that this is going to an oGCD.</p>
<p>Lastly we see the Reaper use a buff or a stance at :44. This stance seems to either change or give access to a GCD that now has a red hue tied it. It&rsquo;s hard to tell if all three hits belong to them same GCD but since the delay is consistent on each usage, we can probably assume its a single GCD.</p>
<p>My best guess is that the new stance will change how your GCD&rsquo;s function and give them a new animation.</p>
<p>Well that is about it. There really is nothing much to speculate here until we have more information. Expect this page to have more depth, detail and insight when we get more than a few crumbs worth of content!</p>

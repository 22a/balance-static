<h1>Reaper - What we know so far</h1>
<div class=content>
<p>As we prepare for Endwalker, the Balance Team is keeping a close eye on anything Reaper related. Currently we only have the job introduction trailer and below will be some an analysis of this video. I wanted to spend sometime addressing where the biggest source of our information will come from, pre launch &ndash; The media tour.</p>
<p>For Shadowbringers the media tour was a pretty huge success, not only for media content creators but also for guide writers and theorycrafters. For the first time we had a ton of detail and information available BEFORE the expansion launched. This gave every job the ability to lay groundwork on rotations and math. We are hoping for a repeat of that success this year. We are currently looking for any content creator, who is attending the media tour, to partner up with us and assist us with obtaining as much information as possible. If you are a content creator who is attending the media tour and you want to help contribute with Reaper theorycrafting, please contact me.</p>
<p>Now for the video analysis:</p>

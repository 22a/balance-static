Ultimates Best-in-Slot Discussion If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to do one of the level 70 Ultimate encounters, you should just sync down current gear. If you wear anything with an Item Level higher than 418 for UCoB or 470 for UWU, you will maximize the two stats on the gear.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:56:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Type !faq drg in #bot_spam for a full list of commands to answer other common questions!
How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready. You activate it by successfully landing the positional on the fifth hit of your combo (Fang and Claw or Wheeling Thrust following Wheeling Thrust or Fang and Claw, respectively).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:55:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</guid><description>Dragoon Opener and Rotation The primary use of the Opener is to prepare your cooldown alignment for the rest of the encounter. With our new job design, it’s possible that we’ll actually have fight-specific openers down the stretch, and they’ll all be added here!
These openers have not been too thoroughly tested as of yet, so please take them with a grain of salt, and if you discover anything that flies counter to what we have listed here, please don’t hesitate to ask!</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</guid><description>Dragoon Skills Overview Global Cooldown Actions (Single Target) Icon Name Acronym Description True Thrust TT Basic combo initiator for both the Chaos Thrust and the Full Thrust combo with 290 potency.

You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. Shadowbringers brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.</description></item><item><title>DRG Leveling Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:47:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</guid><description>The basic single target rotation changes as you progress through the levels.
The general idea is to keep the Disembowel buff up and using the Full Thrust combo as a filler.
The Area of Effect (AoE) rotation, Doom Spike &amp;gt; Sonic Thrust &amp;gt; Coerthan Torment, becomes worth it at three targets. You still want to keep Disembowel up when using this rotation.
Off-Global Cooldown actions such as Jump or Geirskogul, as well as buffs like Lance Charge, should be used on cooldown on all levels.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/saving-the-dragoon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/saving-the-dragoon/</guid><description>Saving The Dragoon Overview Dragoon is a very static melee dps Job.

You&amp;rsquo;ll get one Nastrond and Stardiver under Battle Litany and Lance Charge and the third Nastrond in this Life will double-tap the cloud add.
To go even further beyond, delay the Battle Litany and Lance Charge two GCDs to get an extra Nastrond under these buffs. If the clouds live long enough, you can re-enter Life for another double-tap Nastrond on the cloud right before they feed.</description></item><item><title>DRG Ultimates</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/ultimates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/ultimates/</guid><description>The Weapon&amp;rsquo;s Refrain (UWU) Opener on Garuda: Blood of The Dragon Geirskogul True Thrust Jump Disembowel Chaos Thrust Battle Litany Wheeling Thrust Fang and Claw Dragon Sight True Thrust Lance Charge Mirage Dive Vorpal Thrust Spineshatter Dive Full Thrust Fang and Claw Wheeling Thrust Dragonfire Dive Doom Spike Life Surge Sonic Thrust Geirskogul True Thrust Jump With the pre-pull Geirskogul you will end up (pressing on cooldown) entering Life Of the Dragoon (Life) during the second feather phase for lots of cleaved Nastrond.</description></item><item><title>Opener and Rotation</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/opener-and-rotation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/opener-and-rotation/</guid><description>Dragoon Opener and Rotation The primary use of the Opener is to prepare your cooldown alignment for the rest of the encounter.

Maximize Item Level in every slot. There are very few exceptions to this rule, which can be confirmed via the Gear Calculator Build toward BiS whenever possible. Prioritize Sub-Stats in the general order of: Critical Hit Rate &amp;gt; Direct Hit Rate = Determination &amp;gt; Skill Speed However, stats are not linear growth models.</description></item></channel></rss>

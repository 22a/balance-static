## About Gear

Optimizing substats gives the least return on DPS when compared to being proficient at your job, having high uptime, handling mechanics efficiently, etc.

**BLM has no bad substats.**

Infinite resources and lack of damaging oGCDs makes Spell Speed a strong stat. More SpS can make the job feel smoother to play and make Fire Phases less strict. Aim for higher iLvl gear and get SpS to personal preference and comfort level. After that, worry about your performance rather than your gear.

If you need mathematical backing, [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_bF2q8xADYoCs0IrgKc7bIoGJYFF7YYhR6WJENc248/edit#gid=654212594) lists different BiS sets and can be used to determine BiS for new gear, or what the correct upgrade path is when choosing gear purchase / upgrade priority. 

The biggest takeaway is that as long as your gear is max iLvl and fully melded, the difference between best and worst sets for BLM is less than 1%.

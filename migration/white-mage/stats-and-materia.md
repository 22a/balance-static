# What Substats Does WHM Want? What Should I Meld?

This priority applies to dungeon gear, prog gear, raid gear... **LITERALLY EVERYTHING**.



If you're leveling up or working on prog, grab Piety to comfort and then:  
**Crit > Det | DH**


The most important stat for any healer is piety until you have enough of it, and then any more than you need has no use.   


I cannot tell you how much piety is right for you and your situation. Do not pick the "max damage" set just because it says max damage, in the wrong environment this will do less damage than a "lower" set and will be completely detrimental to your ability to perform well. Picking the set best suited to you will get you the best performance, not the set that says its the best.

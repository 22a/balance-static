# Patch 5.5 BRD tips

* [E9S - Eden's Promise: Umbra (Savage)](#e9s)
* [E10S - Eden's Promise: Litany (Savage)](#e10s)
* [E11S - Eden's Promise: Anamorphosis (Savage)](#e11s)
* [E12S P1 - Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage) ~ Part 1](#e12s-p1)
* [E12S P2 - Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage) ~ Part 2](#e12s-p2)

# E9S - Eden's Promise: Umbra (Savage)

* If you can arrange to stand in a middle square, you can hit boss + cloud with Apex Arrow. Then you can immediately walk out to slow your cloud, or use some 2-target Quick Nocks depending on group strats.
  Holding Apex for 20-30 seconds if it’s full in advance is fine.
* If you can't do this and need to start on a cloud square (i.e. PF things), consider dropping a Caustic Bite on the cloud, or plan to Apex it and the boss as it passes you.

Troubadour recommendations:

* Catch both of the Art of Darkness casts at the start
* Cover the second Wide Angle / Anti Air.
* Deluge of Darkness at the end of panels.
* Either of the Wide Angle / Anti Airs in the second woods phase.

# E10S - Eden's Promise: Litany (Savage)

* You can use Repelling Shot to help with Shadow dodging or Sword Phase transition.
* As with any double tank buster, Minne is good for Umbra Smash if not invuln’d.

Troubadour recommendations:

* Dualspell (the triple stack / shadows sequence).
* If you use the first one early enough, you can catch the first Umbral Orbs.
* After that, ask healers.

# E11S - Eden's Promise: Anamorphosis (Savage)

* Potion a couple seconds earlier pre-pull.
* Nature's Minne on Lightning Tether targets can be helpful.
* After Shifting Sky, do not use Iron Jaws in the re-opener; wait until Stormbite is about to drop.  Then extend the AP that comes around the ~4m mark after Shifting Sky. 

If you did everything right, you'll get BS - (Pot) - IJ (WM) - BS,  netting you a bonus round of buffed DoTs, and a WM fully covered by potion. And all of this on top of the 4m party buff stack that's typically held for 4:30.

* At some kill times (very slow or very fast) you can add Battle Voice to said buff stack without losing a use.
* Rush your second Raging following Sundered Sky - this will bring it back around 10-12s into your WM following Prismatic, nice and comfy.

Troubadour recommendations:

* Lots of options, consult your healers.
* Covering Elemental Breaks and/or Light Orb explosions is a reasonable default.

# E12S P1 - Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage) ~ Part 1

* You can't get more than three Battle Voice uses, so using it at 0/4/8 minutes, or 0/3/6:30, etc. are options depending on your group and kill time.
* Make sure to Minne the more vulnerable tank on each double tank buster.

Troubadour recommendations:

* The very first Obliteration (use ~5-6s into the fight)
* Knockback + Pillar Pierce in Diamond Dust
* Shared laser + Obliteration prior to statues, or the statues sequence itself
* First junction hit + Obliteration at the end

# E12S P2 - Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage) ~ Part 2

* Song cycle manipulation:

  * Use your second and third Ragings earlier than usual, one GCD into WM is fine if you're on point. 
  * Then, use Raging a gcd or so before the Intermediate stun, and WM right before the stun hits. This lets you spend the stunned time accumulating PP stacks. Raging we're just aligning for later. 
  * Once the stun ends, you want to ideally BS (PP + EA) - BS (BL + Bar) - RA, so that you can use a second EA and a second BL under WM before it expires.
  * Rush the next WM, using it right as/after the double Apoc Spirit Taker. You should have Raging and Barrage back in plenty of time to get full usage ahead of Advanced.

After Advanced, you're on a standard WM-MB-AP cycle, with Raging and Barrage appearing a bit deep into WM, but that's okay. 

Troubadour recommendations:

* Knockback + Stack/spread + Pulsar at the beginning.  Use this ~1s after Darkest Dance goes off, timing is tight.
* Shell Crusher + Spirit Taker in Single Apoc
* Shell Crusher + Spirit Taker in Double Apoc
* Any two consecutive Shockwave Pulsars in enrage sequence. Timing to catch both is tight, healers should be made aware.
